first the median does not imply that half of the men are above and half below it simply means that is the mid point between the maximum number of partners and the minimum which is most likely zero

that cops should have a different standard for large black guys than for just large guys in general the original poster never said they were afraid of king because he was black in fact the officers were afraid of king because of what he did not because of the color of his skin it is you mr frank that read the phrase large black man and cried racism in a typical knee jerk fashion when you and

confuse a survey as a study there is a big difference asking people outside of a polling booth and adding up numbers is not a study as easily of been gay i suppose one of the big debates about homosexuality is whether or not it s a type of behavior that is learned or if one is just born that way imho the more likely explanation is that it s some combination of the two based on what besides your own warm fuzzy feelings but this is what you base most of your conclusion upon warm fuzzy feelings maybe he has stated an educated opinion based upon the studies that involve genetics and psychological influence there are a lot of those types of studies aren t there try reading some here s something to ponder upon have any of you gay bashers out there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an intrinsic and natural part of their life as heterosexuals do about their own sexuality in other words someone who is truly alcoholics share that feeling until they hit bottom this is a crap statement and comparison many people use this sad and stupid argument there is not relationship between alcoholics and people s sexual orientation except that some may find what it really is when they are drunk repressed inhibition released unless of course the problem is that homosexuality is a form of mental disorder caused by childhood sexual abuse as a number of recent works suggest nonsense this simply is not true i suppose it is a waste of time to try and tell you to understand what a study presents most of what you cite does not extrapolate anything you do if homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their morality on others antidiscrimination laws and leave our children if people in general would stop using irrational position to oppress other s and leave our private lives to ourselves i would have no support for laws and rules to protect people form this but we need only look at

shortly there after a fire began that has now engulfed all the buildings in the compound only one brach davidian member has come out authorities are saying that branch davidian members were seen starting the fire it looks like there will no witnesses to dispute that claim there were adults an children in the compound funny how the fire seemed to start on the right hand side of the building just next to where a tank was backing away though probably just a coincidence watch the videotape carefully the cnn coverage was fairly decisive the first fire starts in the tower this is three storeys high and there is a flag to the right of it on the picture the second fire starts in another tower which is similar to the first only two storeys high the flag is on the left in the camera picture that shows this fire starting thus the camera pictures cleraly show the fire starting at two separate locations the fbi report a third i was not able to verify it from the videotape however someone else identified a fire shown to be starting behind the small tower in the second flag on left camera angle the flames coming out of the building are yellow orange this is the normal colour for carbon compounds burning the flames were those of a solid or confined liquid burning not of a gas exploding the explosion that occurs mid way along the building is certainly not an explosive though the cloud itself is on fire this would seem to be most likely to be some sort of fuel oil store exploding rather than the explosion of a magazine funny how considering there was to be a great cache of explosives ammunition etc in the compound i did not see any series of explosions depends entirely on how they were distributed you would not be able to identify ammunition rounds going off from video camera coverage from a mile away if and when the fbi release pictures from cmeras on the armoured vehicles which presumably exist it might be possible to get a clearer picture if anyone expects to see explosions hollywood style aka rambo movies then remember that in real life cars do not burst into flames when going over cliffs just about the most you could expect would be to see the grenades going off since the building was designed to be blast proof to some extent it would be difficult to distinguish the grenades going off from the collapse of the building due to the fire and oops the automatic weapons were probably burnt up in the fire with the other witnesses paranoia unless i see videotapes showing the davidians starting the fire i guess i may have a problem believing the feds

otherwise they wouldn t have staged the raid in the first place the paranoid assertion that the batf fired first in an unprovoked assault assumes that the batf were on a death wish had they expected the b d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up in a tank and broken the door down on day one the stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police if anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could hear it napalming seems a bit redundant the stupidity was in the batf mindset we re from washington we know better execute plan a storm the compound in a no knock the locals

mess it up with hillary clinton s plans for socialized medicine john f mcmanus national president of the john birch society when mcmanus says we have the world s best medical care i can hardly believe he s referring to a system that costs us percent of our gdp while there isn t a single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than percent that leaves million of us with no coverage even though all the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone yet americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life expectancy childhood immunization rate infant mortality and many preventable diseases we pay on average about each for mris to put that in perspective they cost in japan the average us company spends over dollars a year per employee on health benefits seven hundred to is the range just about everywhere else how can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world the only thing the usa health care system is good at is showering well insured patients with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it and the private system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient that it itself sucks up over billion dollars a year in money from every other sector of society individuals government and industry of the billion dollars americans threw into the bottomless pit of health care costs last year the consumer s union estimated that at least billion was thrown away on overpriced useless and even downright harmful tests and procedures and the most bureaucratic regulated insurance system in the world there are more than different private insurers in the usa but did the private competition stimulate more efficient paperwork ask any doctor who s had to hire a full time clerk to deal with it all the competition among hospitals is driving costs up not down the competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment spending millions on expensive machines of dubious value that spend percent of the day idle isn t my idea of the world s best health care system competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and expensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful i m especially thinking of heart surgery and some women s surgeries like hysterectomy and cesarean section sound like the world s best health care system ever notice how every time someone tries to bring about some real change in health care the libbies start bashing canada s system first of all hillary clinton is not advocating another canadian system i think that s been made abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months where did john f mcmanus get that idea anyway let s say you re a canadian living in a small town near the usa border your child needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals the nearest canadian cities are hours west and hours east and there s an american city one hour south which way are you going to go is it because the american system is the best in the world or just for convenience it still amazes me that people can t seem to see more than just black and white on health care reform there are a million different ways we ould restructure the system it s not just a choice between total government control and total private control i wish the people screaming socialized medicine every time soemone wants to change the current syste would inform themselves on health care issues the current system sucks i want to keep providers private but that doesn t change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we don t reform the health care system purely private health care without any government intervention doesn t work hillary clinton is not thinking of nationalizing providers or evern insurers how can you scream socialized medicine at her programs don t you even know what you re talking about ever see clinton s graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the decade notice how the line falls then starts increasing why i ll give you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we don t do something about it peope just doesn t get it the current health care system is a cancer which is killing our economic well being costs are still rising

murder of his other followers according to the account given the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the koresh gun supporter claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up if the aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns for all practical purposes they were unarmed the b d followers had automatic weapons the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this is simply rationalisation it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through i must object to the characterization of those opposed to the government s handling of the waco situation as gun supporters your argument tries to paint the batf critics as right wing gun nuts and just mixes up two issues i am one of the batf fbi critics and yet i am a liberal and just as anti gun as you are i just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights even religious crazies they re all human beings not some nest of wasps that you re trying to exterminate the batf created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original raid it was well known that koresh regularly went jogging outside his property he could have been served with a search warrant then he could have been arrested if he had refused to comply instead officers armed with grenades invaded the property this escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both sides those were the first two mistakes the bad judgment of asking for a no knock warrant and the bad and probably illegal way the already unwise warrant was served at this point the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis that s when the government started covering their traces sealing the warrant revising their reported history of the incident etc things were already building up to disaster now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and waited but according to janet reno that option had never been seriously considered so supposedly because the agents were frustrated and fatigued and because there supposedly were no backups they felt they had to go in now it s entirely possible that koresh was responsible for the fire if that s so he deserves the blame for the deaths of the people in his compound but the government s hands are far from clean their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus contempt for the th amendment the motivations for the second raid are just too unbelievable and their coverup of the events of the first raid undermines their credibility in anything they do thereafter we have only some very biased fbi agents word for what happened and please let s not turn this into a pro gun vs anti gun discussion anti gun people do not believe that gun owners deserve

to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place the sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention if the fbi had had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults it really was a no win situation koresh had plenty of opportunity to give up

risky orders of magintude harder than antebbe or the iranian embassy seige airplanes and embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch apocalypse was terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties than allowing the siege to go on was not an option either besides the serious risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over a prolonged period the longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege rather than go in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon can you think of a better way of getting the children out a certain way the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this is simply rationalisation it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through this conspiracy theory assumes that the batf deliberately got of its agents killed and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of texas being shot at by religious nutters still the conspiracy theory is comforting it allows them to pretend that waco proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage crisis no govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully resolved the blame does not rest on the fbi it rests on the fact that koresh was allowed to get so far in particular the person who tipped the b d off in advance has the murder of atf agents and children on his or her conscience there are a large number of people in the us who predict the end of society

hard it is to turn state s witness against someone else no direct experience there though also in some circumstances you may have to sue the insurance plan people here after all sue health insurance companies all the time i heard about a guy in alberta who came down with some rare eye disease that he had to take repeated trips to seattle to get treated it cost him and his family something like and the province years later still has only reimbursed them for or so well what american private insurance plans cover travel expenses since our public insurance plans are publicly accountable one can raise a stink in the media to try and extort benefits beyond which one is entitled hey not alberta s fault that he lives there if he lived in cheyenne wy his private insurance would ve told him to go

purpose as the bethesda naval hospital since not all hospitals can provide everything maybe they have some stuff that others don t ottawa s population is only a quarter million if you include the surrounding counties my point was that something that should necessarily remain unpoliticized has become very politicized to the detriment of its mission i don t think that this has been shown with the dmc the problem is in a system where hospitals annual budgets are approved by the government how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions i bet that if you re an mp or mpp or good friends with one you re put on any hospital s urgent care list no matter how minor your problem which is ok unless you re someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot people of influence will get their way in any system american or european it s the golden rule he who has the gold makes the rules but to what extent does it affect the system and why is an urgent care list necessary in the first place it s worth thinking about it s regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get at what facilities don t americans have to arrange in advance for operations too i think that there are two standards being applied here and that canada can t give beverly hills style treatment to everybody it s not a big brother list it s more like calling around town for a table for dinner yeah but private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow especially in the hospital business yes and the tories in ottawa are trying to make them do that rather than hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the next time around whether it s using mop a couple of weeks longer or even selling services to americans remember our system is cash based and since our health care infrastructure is overbuilt except in specialties that require larger populations to generate business why not the alternative is closing unused wards business whether canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own health services catering toward americans who would be willing to pay more than they do is another issue entirely it must be noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants from the province were getting smaller if those grants are so insubstantial why the need to attract foreigners to make up the difference you answered the question yourself private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow and i think that it s about time that they acted like the private hospitals that they are personally i m fed up with canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance that s one at you bob rae the gdp figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay and are compiled use the same methods by the oecd that yield the figure for the u s but don t the us figures include dentistry and optometry where the canadian one until recently anyway didn t since we have always been evaluated in an oecd style i don t see how remember oecd counts both private and public funds and in canada like france and germany of health care spending is private funds i e not the basic health insurance money so what happens if the health care systems financially collapse how they are collecting premiums and i m an advocate of having copayments like the french do in their system well if you spend more than you take in you go bankrupt it s that simple if the provincial insurance systems find themselves paying out more than they get in revenue they won t be able to pay for everybody s primary care yes the infrastructure will be there but will everybody be able to continue using it at the same rate minor copayments can flush out abusers remember that our system is only an insurance policy but our costs aren t rising fast enough to ensure adequate copayments deductibles last year quebec s user fee proposal came out with the number of as the necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather than give the qma a raise and it s not contract time yet as far as i can tell from upi clarinet even the new reform party a breakoff of traditionalists from the conservatives with a mildly libertarian faction holds our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it s not free the average canadian european is more fiscally naive than their american counterparts on issues like these but no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen but cutting public spending all over the place and bringing back the death penalty with little haste if elected i know that for pete s sake i live right on the border i know the canadian system isn t socialized medicine unlike britain s nhs sorry it s just that i even run into people from buffalo and from michigan who don t know the point is that means that if the money runs low in the plan you re out of luck unless you can afford it yourself yeah but there d be a lot of lead time and a health care crisis that would preclude it if provincial governments as bad as some of them are heck we have the ndp cleaning up a spending mess made by the conservatives in saskatchewan embarassing can be so irresponsible there is still reallocation health insurance is so important that it s about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent insurrection outside of the hockey rink right now attempts to get the system and its users to learn good habits are being treated like cod liver oil would the private insurers take up the slack they d be under no obligation to of course they could eventually make money again but if what you say is true they d be loathe to do so and out of practice in handling such basic services too some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of american companies and their parents provide full insurance down here regardless all firms up north can easily turn on cable tv to see how well the american firms are doing by being involved in basic coverage the private firms are making too much money after having gotten rid of basic coverage they run around patting them selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras for those people who deserve it yeah but eventually it s going to create a kind of two tiered effect that will be noticeable after a while like in britain most americans are fearful of a single tier system seriously there are few areas that have sufficient population for a two more tiered system like what the french have a health policy prof d g shea has cited studies in the nejm that indicate having a population of is necessary for adequate competition and in canada there are only four cities west of the great lakes with that population or larger anyways the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those in the u s and barring any future chernobyl like crisis sudden transients in spending are unlikely in fact the health allocation is one of the most well behaved sectors of spending up north so any talk of bankruptcy is talk radio fodder far away from the border if the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back the things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable this won t be overnight and something like this would force canada to have a system more like the french one but that s not a bad thing and the change will be minimal i e add copayments and frustrate the socialists chanting hey it s free gld je me souviens gary l dare gld

crime rates was almost totally gun related and as was not pointed out in the study but in critiques of it two seperate articles by james wright and david kopel come to mind it was pointed out that the difference was also almost entirely minority related that is the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities blacks and hispanics primarily while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical many of the people who never read the nejm article believe that this critique is valid in fact the study explores the minority issue at length and cites studies to back up its contention that poverty not minority type is the relevant factor in violence statistics perhaps i failed to make myself clear minorities in the u s correlate with poverty this isn t good and we should address it but we shouldnt ignore that minorities and poverty do tend to go together does vancouver have a consistantly poor population drawn along racial lines if it doesn t then assumptions of being able to compare minority vs majority in both cities is questionable at best post hoc ergo propter hoc those areas implemented gun control because of the high rates true only to a certain extent take washington d c where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards similarly for new york actually i don t know whether any serious studies have been done for both cities usenet style statistical arguments are not very serious usually involving people sitting by computers with the latest world almanac figures i had heard of a study on washington dc that seemed to indicate a significant drop in gun related violence there after the laws were implemented i heard gary kleck comment on the radio that he thought the decline in suicide rates was related to the new laws but he doubted their affect on other gun related violence i have never seen a report on the study nor have any of my pro gun friends had much to say about that report remember you can t just say that crime increases indicate a failure of the laws to affect crime rates you don t know whether the rate of increase would have been different without the laws if the rate of increase over a period of several years remains unchanged or increases i think it s not a far jump to say that the laws are not effective no you can t sit down and say that things wouldn t have been worse i don t have a crystal ball and neither do you however that road leads us to a place where it is impossible to critique any action if it gets down to be it might have been worse without them then there is no valid objection which i m sure would amuse certain people to no end you don t know whether the laws prevented a threefold increase or failed to stop a two fold increase so we ve got a situation where we have several options the crime rate decreased obviously gun control worked the crime rate remained the same it would have been worse without gun control the crime rate increased perhaps the laws prevented an even bigger increase cute testing ground we ve got all responses support the proposition that gun control works the question is this did washington d c experiance an increase in its violent and or gun crime rate which was greater than the pattern indicated prior to the implemented gun control laws if it did then the suggestion that the problem the

government that i advocate fractal federalism with fractal federalism there is a representative national government that has only certain limited powers to do what is absolutely necessary at that level next there are the state governments again with only absolutely necessary powers onward to counties cities townships districts and neighborhoods the lowest read most local levels are the ones that have the most power over individuals day to day lives which is good because that is the level where individuals have the most voice you know if you take all this to its logical conclusion doesn t it seem that the real lowest level the level where individuals have the most voice is that of the single individuals themselves why have you omitted that level from your model yes and the individual is not omitted i just didn t fully articulate the principles of fractal federalism all government powers derive from the people each level can receive a new power from the level below through the amendment process where a true consensus say a majority writes that power into the constitution of the level above in the case of the lowest level an amendement is passed by a majority vote in the case of higher levels it must be passed by of the legislatures we can of course haggle about the specifics of true consensus when we hold our constitutional convention once a power has been granted it may be exercised by the legislature powers not in the original constitutions must percolate upward starting from the individual the ratification process for the original constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a plurality or majority granting a right in a constitution is of course the same as empowering the government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments at the lower levels so it operates in the same way as the amendment process again that crazy resemblance to the supposed but not actual u s government structure this government structure is a very frustrating one for those people read liberals who would like to have concentrated power to use the government to force people to do good a difficult to define word and one that it is difficult to reach a consensus on it is also a frustrating structure for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior read big government conservatives i personally would rather see those types of people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty both civil and economic that is going on now this is imho a good government stucture for those who see the role of government as the protection of individual liberties while still recognizing that individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that they live in a free market works on government not just economics succesful ideas propogate unsuccessful ideas die what is your definition of a successful idea or a successful government one which maintains peace liberty and the opportunity for happiness for its people while working within the realities of human nature you do bring up the point intentional or not that a lasting idea is by no means necessarily a successful idea i believe that fractal federalism would at least bring many ideas to light and the people would have the opportunity to democratically choose between good ideas and bad ideas if the docialists er i mean democrats are right and government activism fosters a prosperous people they will have a plethora of local opportunities to check their thesis if libertopia is possible it will arise if a balanced conservative republic is democratically received as the best level of government activity it will become clear to the people that it is best as far as set the moral tone is concerned if a community does not collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of their kids why should they have to if a community does not want to see proliferation of drugs among their kids why should they have to for the same reason that they have to put up with a church operating right out in the open where their kids can see it and with the owner of the house across the street flying an american flag right out there in the open every day in front of their kids it s called freedom if they don t like the ideas to which their kids are exposed they can try to educate and persuade their kids as to why the things that they re seeing other people doing are wrong or bad right and people would not rescind any freedoms read empower the government except through the amendment process that is how the federal government is supposed to work now but the supreme soviet er i mean the supreme court put a stop to that republican government nonsense in my hypothetical government if there were a constitutional provision empowering the government to regulate churches the government whatever level we are talking about could indeed ban churches the constitutional provision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision protecting free exercise of religion the uppermost constitution is still the supreme law of the land i find it interesting that you applaud the idea of free market competition among various ideas and yet support the right of he majority in a community to suppress ideas which they don t like it is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations and environment not a matter of suppression of ideas one dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty and they also need to have some control over their environment in my fractal federalism government certain rights are protected by the constitutions other rights are protected simply because the government has not been empowered to infringe upon them when a consensus is reached that the government should have a certain power then freedom is infringed upon this cannot be avoided murder statutes infringe upon freedom but i think that the consensus of the american people is that murder statutes are a good idea i am sure that many parents believe that they have a right to control the environment that their children live in people feel that they have a right to sleep peacefully at night thus there are noise ordinances there are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential neighborhoods i do not view these as bad things certainly some individual instances are bad but the concept is not necessarily bad i view them as the people in a community having some control over the type of community that they live in i see the alternative as near anarchy like i said in another post if you can come up with a scenario where an individual can do something truly autonomously with absolutely zero effect on anyone else then no individual or government has the right to restrict that activity there are simply not very many behaviors that fit into the category of the truly autonomous so the whole thing becomes an issue of one individual or group having power over another individual or group i think that the fractal federalism approach is a sound if not ideal approach to limiting this restrictive power the libertarian scenario degenerates to might makes right and the system we have right now is one of lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what powers the government should have by subverting the democratic process though the supreme court the problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the fundamental dilemma of democratic government the people have a right to exercise a voice in their community yet individuals have the right to be left to themselves this is a serious dilemma precisely because there is not much that takes place in a vacuum oddly enough if what you say is taken literally there is little or no conflict the people do indeed have a right to exercise a voice where voice equals persuasive speech in their communities it s only when they somehow get the idea into their heads that they also have a right to dictate behavior in their communities that the trouble begins i think i answered this above already but let me expand a little more with an example if i stand naked in front of your house and masturbate in front of your children while they play in your libertarian small l scenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me autonomous is a value judgement of the time it is not a scientific reality with a clear definition exactly who would you empower to make that value judgement stuff deleted certainly not the only cause mike but people in a local neighborhood should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood to deny this is to create another concentrated centralized power to keep the locality from abusing its power in essence using a pit bull to keep a toy poodle from biting your leg chances are the pit bull is going to turn on you some day and you have much less defense against it than you do against the toy poodle the argument here appears to be that tyranny of the individual by the local majority is superior to having the federal government have and exercise the power to protect the individual from his neighbors because that federal government will eventually and inevitably become corrupt and use its power to tyrannize everyone okay there s a lot of truth in that certainly we re seeing something like that happening in the united states today though it s unclear that he progression here matches the model since our beloved and benign federal government hasn t ever shown much enthusiasm for the idea of protecting any individuals lots of people are long on complaints and short on practical solutions although i am pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit i am at least trying to be long on solutions also i am truly interested if you have any improvements to make on my ideas i call them my ideas but they all come from an average guy reading of the u s constitution without benefit of the indoctrination of constitutional law academia but i have to say that i think that your solution is at least just as bad trading the yoke of federal tyranny for the yoke of local tyranny doesn t cheer me up much i think i d prefer to put my faith in a larger government that at least might protect the individual from time to time rather than place it in local mob rule admittedly it s the lesser of two evils and it s not less by very much and they re both pretty damn evil sorry the confusion was my fault when i said that fractal federalism resembles the u s constitution i meant it and thought it was pretty clear i should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government power is from the consensus of the people although not the consent of every individual a practical observation not a moral judgement it is certainly better than having all government power derive from nine lawyers which is the situation we have now that is why i think the supreme court should be a jury court with a different jury for each case it is certainly not perfect no philosophy of government is but do you still find it a repugnant idea if so what is your solution ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government coercive power of any kind would be necessary this will never work because people are different and by their nature they will always want to force their views on others if this were not the case nobody would try to force their view that murder is wrong on anyone else this is true the question is what we you going to do about it your proposed solution seems to actually encourage these bozos to lord it over their victims i think that you misunderstood the structure of the form of government i advocate and it was my fault for not being more clear oh and by the way liborgalism thinking is irrelevant integrity is irrelevant free speech is irrelevant private property is irrelevant personal responsibility is irrelevant conservativism is futile you will be assimilated how much would freedom of speech or private property rights be respected in a community in which the majority was allowed to make all the rules that man s saying things in public that i don t want my children exposed to let s shut him up those homos are living together and fornicating in that house over there let s run em outta town the majority does not make the rules the

who has just murdered children and ordered the suicide murder of his other followers according to the account given the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the koresh gun supporter claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up if the aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns for all practical purposes they were unarmed the b d followers had automatic weapons the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this is simply rationalisation it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through i must object to the characterization of those opposed to the government s handling of the waco situation as gun supporters your argument tries to paint the batf critics as right wing gun nuts and just mixes up two issues i am one of the batf fbi critics and yet i am a liberal and just as anti gun as you are i just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights even religious crazies they re all human beings not some nest of wasps that you re trying to exterminate the batf created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original raid it was well known that koresh regularly went jogging outside his property he could have been served with a search warrant then he could have been arrested if he had refused to comply instead officers armed with grenades invaded the property this escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both sides those were the first two mistakes the bad judgment of asking for a no knock warrant and the bad and probably illegal way the already unwise warrant was served at this point the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis that s when the government started covering their traces sealing the warrant revising their reported history of the incident etc things were already building up to disaster now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and waited but according to janet reno that option had never been seriously considered so supposedly because the agents were frustrated and fatigued and because there supposedly were no backups they felt they had to go in yes the govt handled it in the rambo hollywood type style with extreeme machismo perhaps thats not the way to handle it it is a completely different thing to start asserting as many have done that the government is primarily to blame the comparisons with the nazis in particular are purely gratuitous since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your post desreves to be taken seriously peter nelson also made some very good points about how a low key approach might have been more effective the point is though that you learn through mistakes the govt played the wrong card and lost thats not a big deal they had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they just were not prepared for wuite this situation who could be if the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps be able to castigate the govt if they used the same tactics and failed in the same way as it is i can t say that i would not have made the same mistake maybee i wouldn t because i don t as a rule go in for a confrontational situation if i can avoid it maybee i would because with all those press about its very difficult not to try the macho stuff the fbi had information from within the compound we had no access to they may have calculated that the b d followers resolve was cracking based on their listening devices within the compound they knew that koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt this may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have been a weapon for breaking his resolve again in panama they had used the heavy rock music to great effect during bush s invasion funny that few of the koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the death of several thousand pananmanian civilians while the us govt attempted to arrest their former ally and please let s not turn this into a pro gun vs anti gun discussion anti gun people do not believe that gun owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government agents and koresh s civil rights exist whether his guns were legal illegal illegal but should have been legal or whatever koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired on the police helicopter no matter whether the warrant was or was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out thought that it was thus the assault on them was completely inexcusable no matter what

include the general welfare in another portion of the constitution article i section the congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states i guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they said in the preamble but since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense in article i section i guess you ll grant that botha are constitutional functions right james madison federalist paper it has been urged and echoed that the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged

the problem would be mitigated a great deal those who would create broad non enumerated government powers at any level as in european parlamentary democracies and the current de facto standard in the u s have essentially engaged in the same fundamental mistake except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian virtually unchecked except by plurality election death or retirement government power and why should your community be allowed to stop my activities when i m not picking your pocket or defrauding you just because you don t like it because you find it morally repugnant this is like asking why the wind blows unless you can prove that the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to your engagement in those activities very few human activities indeed fit into this category even for those few that do who would you empower to make the judgement of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity who defines picking my pocket and defrauding are economic assets a person s only assets or are peace of mind stability confidence in a child s emotional environment security and many other things not also a part of a person s assets what gives you the right to create a moral environment that a parent strongly objects to what gives you the right to create an environment of social unrest and instability if you say that what you do does not have those effects by what authority do you say that who is empowered to make these value judgements how would you feel if i got a gang together and found xtianity or insert your favorite cause here morally repugnant and passed laws to outlaw its free exercise all at a local level since that seems to be a ok with you if the federal constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so the federal government would prevent you from doing so if it did not and you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local constitution by say a majority empowering the local government to do so then i would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood more friendly to my own system of values this is not an ideal situation but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now as to the gang of pitchfork and torch wielding friends there are very few restrictive local laws that i personally would advocate or vote for since i am of the view that exercising government power over your neighbors should be done with extreme care and only when absolutely necessary but i do believe in protecting children from victimization by people who have callous disregard for the effects they have on others i would certainly leave a well behaved massage parlor alone so long as it had no detrimental effects on the neighborhood you just don t get it the debate is not whether you or a communitity would or would not vote away my rights it is the propriety of whether that should even be an option when you define rights very broadly there is no practical choice about whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these rights overlap even when rights are defined very narrowly the government has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights the fundamental question is by whose authority is that power created if you support the current situation with a natural rights supreme court rather than an original understanding supreme court or even better supreme court by jury you are consenting to having nine lawyers in washington d c create those powers out of the air in my fractal federalism scenario it is a broad consensus of the people i e the amendment process that creates those powers certainly not the only cause mike but people in a local neighborhood should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood to deny this is to create another concentrated centralized power to keep the locality from abusing its power you mean that horrific centralized power the individual no i mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to tell the locals how to run their neighborhood waco tx is a nice example in essence using a pit bull to keep a toy poodle from biting your leg chances are the pit bull is going to turn on you some day and you have much less defense against it than you do against the toy poodle ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government coercive power of any kind would be necessary this will never work because people are different and by their nature they will always want to force their views on others if this were not the case nobody would try to force their view that murder is wrong on anyone else fine when they force their views on others prosecute them until then leave them alone this is such a simple concept how do you feel about speech codes hate speech certainly could be considered an indication that the pit bull is going to turn some day should the community be allowed to limit it too if not why not if you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the cause of personal autonomy have you done anything different what precisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to if you list them perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly autonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them and how do you feel about david koresh did he deserve it should the batf or a local version of same be allowed to toss him in jail just because they think he s off his rocker the koresh incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means i would abolish the constitutionality of no knock warrants seems very dubious to me not to mention the mere existence of batf and the government s propensity to ignore the word infringe in the second amendment this power is upheld by the same body with its incredible concentration of power in the hands of nine people that has upheld much so called civil rights read affirmative action legislation despite the fourteenth amendment who said anything about the public till get rid of it and get out

back off continuing the siege was one of the few alternatives to what actually took place and it s a matter of debate whether any of these would have ended any better how about letting in the press how about letting koresh out to talk to the press maybe if he had been allowed to talk with the press tv for a couple of days he would have surrendered peacefully how about letting the relatives of koresh s followers talk seems to me when you isolate someone try to send them crazy by playing loudspeakers through the night of tibetan chants etc you don t have much to stand on when they behave as

the travel expenses it was the whole treatment when you buy insurance where you live it is based on the local rates tourists coming from say utah will find that there is a difference in what their insurance will cover fob provo and what they get stuck with at lenox hill or mount sinai if they fall ill in the big apple but to what extent does it affect the system and why is an urgent care list necessary in the first place it s worth thinking about it s regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get at what facilities don t americans have to arrange in advance for operations too i think that there are two standards being applied here and that canada can t give beverly hills style treatment to everybody it s not a big brother list it s more like calling around town for a table for dinner but americans need far less advance time to book operations it would depend on where you live downtown toronto or mile british columbia just like cheyenne wy vs boston ma again geography rears its ugly head since our health care providers are private they depend on an adequate market size in order to sustain enough business since our health care professionals have equivalent take home pay to their american cousins it s not that they re being paid too little to provide services whether canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own health services catering toward americans who would be willing to pay more than they do is another issue entirely it must be noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants from the province were getting smaller if those grants are so insubstantial why the need to attract foreigners to make up the difference you answered the question yourself private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow and i think that it s about time that they acted like the private hospitals that they are personally i m fed up with canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance that s one at you bob rae true but i was thinking does can anybody compete with the provinces to offer basic health coverage i remember reading that that sort of private health insurance is actually illegal in canada i have only hear americans say that it s illegal but i could be wrong just have never heard it from a canadian source our private insurance has recently balked in quebec when the liberals proposed privatizing some aspects of routine care also our insurance was put in place when no ndp labour governments were in power in any province to derail the effort cos they wanted real socialized medicine you re not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one insurance plan no it is optional as it is optional for doctors to accept it there are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for exemptions and one e mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verified for me that it is indeed negative option i guess that you can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance but so far i ve not come across that up north and i take pains to keep tabs with news from home and that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an effective cartel they don t really need to compete because as you put it they re in a win win situation and they re guaranteed to turn a profit believe me they probably had orgasms when they figured that out and according to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to the point of ungraciousness at chamber of commerce luncheons interesting side note have any new insurance companies started up from scratch since medicare became standard in canada i actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since ww i no scratch that there are a few in western canada and quite a few in quebec as part of the post quebec miracle out with the nationalism in with the french capitalism la groupe des cooper antes built a new tower by the eaton s store at les terraces and if you were able to catch urban angel on cbs s crimetime you d see it as the well lit one with double turrets at the top as for ontario which still dominates and anchors business up north canada is a very old money kind of place and the free trade agreement saw a lot of odd alliances labour unions and establishment old money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one side and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and professionals on the other the final trudeau administration and the first mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux riches who knew what it was like to make your own money and that motivated the mcdonald commission under trudeau which set up brian s initiative macaroni was against free trade til he did a head count of his caucus after the election it s not really insurance if you don t have alternatives well you have to realize that in our society that s like saying that it s not really national defence because you can t hire your own rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist btw there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their portion of taxes but never people arguing over health insurance alternatives and we re talking about a press that is hostile to whomever is in government regardless of party one of their few redeeming characteristics it seems also in the april globe and mail there was a letter from the director of trauma services at st michael s hospital in toronto responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in california and canada in which some canadian doctor worried that american analysts would seize on the results as proof that canada rationed vital services the doctor i can t recall his name said that canada is rationing vital services as any physician can plainly see he said that a system in which people are refused treatment because they can t afford it is no different from a system in which people are refused treatment because the government can t afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health insurance plan in fairness he did say that both the us and canadian systems are in the same situation the only way to hit at the canadian system is transient periods of high demand which is more a function of the doctors monopoly s tight fist on the licencing an obvious difference is that in such a transient period the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling over cabbage patch dolls tm as we ve seen recently as opposed by rationing by ability to pay but the former is a transient situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the california health infrastructure the same would result rationing among the insured population with smaller markets there is much less flexibility when dealing with our insured population than california which by the way has rd more people than canada in a much more dense area so he is correct in that the resources are fixed for a particular time window or as a function of the doctors monopoly licencing according to the market steady state in either case as for being refused treatment the government of the day would be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen canadians can be geographically bad too not realizing that their health care is private while only their insurance isn t too many people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized medicine i know i know the monopoly power of canadian doctors often leads them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more money from the government another case of businessmen once scratched becoming socialists right as i ve pointed out above but hasn t that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place to the other it hasn t really solved it either way the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp in the light of disasters e g chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart disease a doctor needs years of training plus internship and specialty training people too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their insurance when they really don t need to that s why i ve argued for deductible and copayments rather than education which is what most canadian fiscal conservatives are arguing for the leftists ah just let em spend yeah right also note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions under some high dollar threshold in most it s your private insurance that covers it just like in the u s still it all adds up in the oecd measures in fact buffalo may be the only place in the us where people get don cherry jokes we get the sabres feed as a replacement game on espn tonight the devils local metro ny coverage supplants the main espn game the ndp cleaning up a tory spending mess and just when i thought i understood canadian politics yeah it s a sad story and saskatchewan tory leader grant devine has been on a nonstop pr campaign to save his sorry butt the sask ndp have taken a neo conservative turn like hawke gonzalez and mitterand did has anybody considered following singapore s example and going to a system where the company and the state buys basic and catastrophic coverage for everybody and then you also have an ira sort of thing to which you and your employer can can contribute for medical expenses only it would tend to discourage you from overusing it the medical ira would have limited use as you d need a lower catastrophic threshold else there d still be a drain on the public purse if someone exhausts their ira also singapore has a much more autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses if singaporeans that i ve met are any indication i don t mean any disprespect here where they d let you just die one of the good things about being the last country to create a national health care system should we decide to is that we have everybody else s mistakes to learn from that s true the question is how much leeway is there between the u s approach and the second most capitalist approaches of canada france and germany seriously there are few areas that have sufficient population for a two more tiered system like what the french have a health policy prof d g shea has cited studies in the nejm that indicate having a population of is necessary for adequate competition and in canada there are only four cities west of the great lakes with that population or larger but there are many cities in the us with that kind of population yes many and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too far from a bigger town just take a look at a detailed atlas or better take a flight from pittsburgh or rochester to toronto my first time across lake ontario to nyc i was amazed by the increase in density and the toronto region is the densest in all of canada there was one about a group of doctors in calgary who have opened canada s first us style mri clinic as an alternative to the provincially owned one it s about time i ve ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they don t invest in their own private practices in the end it s their money but they choose to spend it on america s cup pipedreams and that s none of my business as for provincially owned for sure it s against the law in canada for governments to be directly involved in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser vations what that term actually means is that the facility gets by on public grants to meet shortfall from lack of use no kidding medical practice itself is much more conservative up north my own best friend did two clerkships at the mayo clinic in rochester mn and is no stranger to high tech medicine but his boat comes first there were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of two tiered health care and that it might violate the canada health act no it s probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have private practices and always have they can all take cash anyways so why not have a particular facility the canadian big government mentality often imagines government where it does not even exist since the french and germans have become more entrepreneurial and less laidback without sacrificing their culture and values then canadians can do the same as i ve pointed out above the law states that it is illegal for the government to provide any health services except for the military and natives look nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the mri nobody stopped them when they bought it nobody seems to be stopping them from using it either much ado about nothing thank goodness that hockey playoffs have started while it seemed currently unjustified there was one anecdote told by the head of the partnership to demonstrate the mri he showed an image of an injured knee which happened to belong to the manager of the bank who approved the loan he said that without it the guy might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial mri then another length of time for treatment after which the muscles would have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder if that isn t the first whiff of two tiers i don t know what is i m certain there is exaggeration somewhere because the gao study of canada cited often on usenet did not find access to mri to be a problem i ll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened to american trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit there are already a few treatment regimens for knee

concerned about surprise when they intended to serve the warrant by knocking on the door the batf appears to be inconsistant in their own description of events and in any case how does one mount an

should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute boomer v atlantic cement co was an action brought by one party boomer whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by another party the atlantic cement company the facts supported boomer s contention that atlantic cement was wrongfully damaging his property and boomer asked the court to order atlantic cement to stop doing so end of story there was no reason for the court to consider such issues as what a capitalistic society would want atlantic cement to do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage faced by the plaintiffs those issues had nothing to do with the case before the court bill if the government had stepped in and the epa made a regulation requiring multi million dollar cement plants to be shut down because of a smattering of cement dust at a cost benefit ratio of you d be up in arms why is it okay for the judicial branch to interfere this way but not the legislative or executive branches i d be up in arms why do you assume that quite the contrary i d probably support the action since it would be based on the same general doctrine as the decision that i believe would have been correct in boomer the idea that people s property rights should not be violated for reasons of economic efficiency in boomer it was boomer s property rights which i believe the court should have protected in the hypothetical epa ruling you ve presented it s the american people s collective property rights in a healthy physical environment what good is cost benefit ratio of if you wind up with cement dust in your air your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant if the state of massachusetts came up with a similar regulation you d be up in arms and complaining about interference with property rights and fifth amendment violations once again why is it okay for the judicial branch to interfere this way but not the legislative or executive branches or are you not the libertarian you present yourself as being ted frank how would it be per se illegal to operate a cement plant wouldn t it just mean that when buying land for a cement plant you would have to either buy enough land so that most of the pollution would stay on your land or buy pollution easements from the surrounding landowners tim smith all it takes is one holdout out of hundreds of neighbors to scrap the plant furthermore each of the neighbors is going to want the full benefit of the bargain under the resulting bilateral monopoly a bonanza for lawyers to be sure who get to negotiate each of these agreements a windfall for homeowners who can extort away any profits the plant would make but not particularly good for society yes so what the courts are supposed to protect the specific rights of individuals not the general interests of some nebulous society if society can have its cement plant without violating anyone s rights fine otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less cement plant see ted i really am a libertarian after all that s the whole point behind the coase theorem in a world without transactions costs the land will automatically be put to the best use as it is transferred from person to person instantaneously without friction the legal regime will not matter because the result will be the same in a world such as ours one with transactions costs one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with in order to minimize the transactions costs one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with in order to minimize the transactions costs which one are you speaking of i want the legal regime to protect people s rights besides coase s theorem only has real application in the never never land of perfectly rational actors in the real world some people are going to be stubborn ornery spiteful or otherwise irrational from a economic point of view and the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so i don t care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing of damage to my property per head so i should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for say per head i still retain the right to tell you that i just plain don t want any damned cattle on my property not at any price and then you say everyone s property rights were protected the plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were avoided as above i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were made whole they were in fact by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them wdstarr then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made whole because the award of damages in involuntary why should we treat a nuisance plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff we don t require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation why in tort last question first for the same reason as in contract law because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the thirteenth amendment as to your then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made whole because the award of damages in involuntary claim you re at least partially right faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and cannot be reversed or undone courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer in these cases the sale has already taken place and is irreversible and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid under the doctrines that a only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and b even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere but neither is relevant to cases like boomer in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and can be reversed undone i e prevented from happening at all by order of the court in these types of cases all the court has to do is require that the potential victim s property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually acceptable price there is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding it can leave that operation up to the parties themselves and again i ask since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that unnecessary settlement costs are avoided if so i ve been miseducated i always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive in cases like boomer they re simply a cost of doing business the fact that the proprietors of the atlantic cement co got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without first trying to negotiate with boomer and everyone else whose property rights they d be violating via the operation of their plant there s nothing punitive or unjust about it it is completely sensible only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and the alleged right of several hundred atlantic cement employees to not have their jobs disappear should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by atlantic cement s wrongful acts wdstarr anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire set of possessions to wronged person weren t you complaining about excess punitive damages before anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be required to buy the right to do so from the victim in advance and the seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege no injustice no punitive damages you d like posner bill he s a libertarian really i didn t know that what if anything has he had to say about cases like boomer wdstarr in eal he cites it as an example of bilateral monopoly that the court correctly avoided i m sure its covered in the landes and posner book on tort law presumably favorably but i don t have that book in front of me doesn t sound very much like a libertarian to me libertarians tend to believe in the rights of individual people not societies i ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as law and economics is weak if it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many tie breaker factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute as measured by the scale of justice is evenly balanced fine but as illustrated by boomer it is not fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case wdstarr in this case the justice of the case was intricately tied up with the economics of the case atlantic cement committed a tort causing k of damage should it pay in the millions or just compensate for the damage it committed as stated above the tort was ongoing atlantic cement wanted to be able to continue to violate boomer s rights while the court may have been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already committed it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the future violations of boomer s rights and to then force boomer to sell at that price william december starr wdstarr

cleaning up the mess and assigning blame from the onset of the april tear gas attacks by federal agents president clinton already started passing the buck by saying talk to the attorney general or the

took full responsibility for the decision i approved the plan she said adding that she did not advise him clinton as to the details in fact she told clinton that it was the best way to go as the fire was roaring through the branch davidian s compound clinton said that he was deeply sadened by the loss of life and in the same breath that the law enforcement agencies involved in the waco siege recommended the course of action pursued today later he went on to say i stand by that reno s decision how did this all begin at on february agents of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms batf launched a full scale high profile assault on the branch davidian s compound this raid was much more than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons the assault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the batf to show their might and just purpose at the onset of the no knock raid gaggles of heavily armed batf agents made their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state that they had a warrant until long after the shooting began silently the agents made their way to the compound s buildings and started their search by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades and ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings if unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues were to attack you throwing grenades and brandishing firearms would you not assume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself the tactics employed by the batf provoked the battle the initial assualt by the batf was not successful unfortunately lives were lost on both sides but had the assault been a success the liberal media would have praised the batf by showing the footage of batf agents carting away a bunch of gun wielding religious nuts of course any violation of the cult s rights would have been overlooked and the media would proclaim america s fortune in having super cop organizations like the batf that can systematically take out terroristic groups such as the branch davidians as far as i can see the batf and the fbi dropped the ball just like philadelphia did in the move crisis which left

flushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds what ever happened to this is the police you are surrounded it this policy of no knock raids by federal and local agencies should be restricted

and use it to support some position you present seems somewhat contradictory doesn t it i believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that the quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the subject at hand the media has proven itself very accurate is the areas of presenting raw undisputed data one good example would be the weather page in which high and low temperatures of the previous day for a large number of locations are posting there is little evidence to show that they are in error i believe this true when we speak of physical data in the sense of pure science but when we speak of data that revolve around social sciences then we have to be careful the american media has failed us in its analysis of complex events however i m sure that we can come up with many news stories that have left us angry because so many facts have been ommitted cases that come to mind are the invasion of panama the war with iraq the disaster in waco the issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the military the war on drugs and many others i quite agree but these are cases or news events that contain politics social science information sociology etc and at best are reflections of the group that reports them as you have pointed out it is difficult to report that the temperature was degrees when it was degrees and have people believe you the story that you bring to light was regarding the new sex survey while i m sure that due to lazyness some of the data was ommitted from the article i would venture to guess that the data that was presented did not deviate from the survey i do however think that it would be folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter s analysis of this data in this particular case there was little analysis and the reader was left to draw his her own convictions yes and no the survey presented according to mr cramer a value called the median which one used this makes us believe that of the males had plus sex partners and of the

article apr msuvx memst edu kebarnes msuvx memst edu said i m for creating a class of noncommercial drugs which would include the currently illegal ones which would be legal to possess grow produce but not to sell bomb the pushers back to the barter age and tax production too um why what s wrong with the act of selling recreational drugs even for mercenary reasons e g getting rich note by selling i mean selling the product to a consenting adult at a mutually agreeable price i point this out in an effort to pre emptively prevent this thread from getting sidetracked onto a flamefest about pushing drugs to schoolchildren or the like and why should the users be subjected to special taxation william december starr note this is a repost of my earlier response to mr starr which was not properly formatted apologies to those who ve seen the following before to explain my position on the war on drugs i offer this drugs and crime a new approach by ken barnes given that the trade in illegal drugs is responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation people who want drugs particularly people who are predisposed to addiction will find a way to get them whether or not they are legally available despite current law enforcement efforts drugs are readily available to those who want them addiction to drugs both legal and illegal is responsible for a significant drain on the productive resources of our country and this occurs in a variety of ways from the cocaine addicted babies who are unable to learn to the spread of disease among addicts to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking a general economic principle of government is that whatever is subsidized you get more of and whatever is taxed you get less of to be most effective in confronting the nation s drug problem some way must be found to utilize these additional powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use less attractive while this country s current efforts to combat legal drugs have succeeded in some respects there is a greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking and designated driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving for example the same cannot be said for the war on illegal drugs there remains a core group of illegal drug users which support international networks of smugglers pushers growers processors kingpins and gangsters these networks and their marketing activities which include drive by shootings corrupting law enforcement authorities and smuggling weapons are directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed in our country every day clearly illegal drugs and rising crime are linked it takes only a moment s reflection to recognize how they are linked the link is money as with this country s failed effort to prohibit alcohol consumption a black market has been created in which greedy local monopolies like the gangsters of a bygone era have profited enormously from their illegal trade the victims of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire but i would argue the drug users themselves were it not for the black market and the violent monopoly of the drug lords drug users might not be the thieves robbers prostitutes and murderers they have become in order to pay the high prices the drug lords demand in the absence of the drug lords most would be i believe simply people with a problem either a moral problem or a medical problem but not a criminal problem let me be clear however i am not advocating that we let the criminals who have been preying on our society for these many years of prohibition off the hook on the contrary the new approach i advocate is one which would not result in either the government or private industry getting into the business of promoting crack cocaine or any other presently illegal drug for that matter neither is it an approach which sees law abiding citizens handing over more and more of their freedom and privacy in an effort to track down illegal drug users until the land of the free and the home of the brave looks like a police state here then is my proposal possession and use of all presently illegal drugs is decriminalized but buying and selling them remains illegal potheads can grow their own marijuana as many already do today other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle if these drugs can be obtained for free or next to nothing why buy them nevertheless there will be those who will seek to sell these noncommercial drugs even at relatively low prices therefore law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices but here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers the victimizers and the drug users their victims upon arrest for any crime suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of if they are found to be a drug user they will be institutionalized until they are clean and only then will they begin to serve their sentence if they choose to cooperate and are already drug free they can begin to serve their sentence right away those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes drug using criminals and this includes drunk and or stoned drivers are separated from their sources of supply thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business institutionalization provides an incentive for drug using criminals to straighten themselves out before becoming part of the general prison population while helping protect society from crime institutionalization could also serve to deter drug users from becoming criminals since drug using criminals unlike other criminals would be delayed prior to serving their sentences by the additional time it takes for them to sober up institutionalization of drug using criminals separate from the general prison population would also provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could volunteer for research studies of new techniques and treatments for addictive disease with the potential to benefit both themselves and others dealers in illegal drugs are generally not drug users themselves and this is particularly true of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit organizations under this proposal dealers would be more readily identifiable since upon arrest they would presumably pass the drug test or else decline to take it in order to avoid having to explain why they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent they do not use them declining to take the test they would of course face stiffer penalties while each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug would have to stand on own its merits the outcome of a suspect s drug test could provide additional evidence for the prosecution just as cigarette taxes have contributed to the decline of smoking in our country by making cigarettes more costly while at the same time providing revenue for anti smoking campaigns noncommercial drugs should be taxed and the money generated should be used to combat their use enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis however and should not be used as an excuse to infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial drug users since to do so would have the effect of reintroducing prohibition instead drug users will be encouraged to pay the tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever found in their possession during the course of routine police operations they will be required to pay the tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to be destroyed if drug dealers are found to be selling noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid they will face additional prosecution for evading the tax the strategy of adding tax evasion to drug dealing charges is already in use in some jurisdictions but its effectiveness is currently limited by the illegality of drug possession revenue from drug possession taxes and import tariffs would be used to fund anti drug advertising campaigns and provide support to private sector drug treatment programs for those unable to afford treatment taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must be ended federal support of tobacco farming is both immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets and the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands in many states must likewise be eliminated while my proposal would have the effect of permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs it would hold the users of all drugs responsible for their actions and i believe would reduce the harm drugs have on our society particularly the crime caused by the illegal drug trade so long as we remain a free nation with relatively porous borders and freedom for our citizens to travel we will always have a drug problem whether it takes the form of heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings drunk drivers killing and maiming others on our streets or emphysema patients struggling for breath after a lifetime of smoking the results are the same needless suffering and death as a society we must recognize that while our society permits us to harm ourselves with drugs as we are already doing regardless of the drug laws we must take a stand against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to others we must particularly oppose the vicious and violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug users by taking the profits out of their deadly trade my proposal goes a long way towards shutting down these powerful criminal organizations the question of whether drug use is a moral or medical problem depends on which group of drug users you re talking about different drugs have different effects and some are more addictive than others the addictiveness of a drug also often varies between individuals and so we have some people who can drink alcohol in moderation while others find they cannot resist the bottle nicotine which former surgeon general c everett koop declared to be as addicting as heroin is a legal drug with known harmful effects and while some people can stop smoking by willpower alone others continue to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer for those individuals who can stop taking drugs on their own we may argue that because they have chosen to use them this represents a moral failure on their part or an unwillingness to face the difficulties of life but for the addicts while they may have chosen to use drugs the first time by the time they discover their addiction it is too late we cannot hold them responsible for their disease any more than we would blame someone who is drowning for an inability to swim perhaps they should have known not to go near the water or perhaps someone should have warned them of the danger but in their present circumstances warnings will not help neither does it help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing them weights

cunixb cc columbia edu gary l dare writes v pxgt ubvmsb cc buffalo edu daniel b case writes also in the april globe and mail there was a letter from the director of trauma services at st michael s hospital in toronto responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in california and canada in which some canadian doctor worried that that study which was in the nejm i think noted that the frequency of heart surgery on patients over seventy increase with income in california i guess richer people have more heart disease in california whereas the frequency of surgery on patients over seventy in canada was relatively uniform across income distribution heart surgery was more frequent in california but mortality and outcomes were essentially the same american analysts would seize on the results as proof that canada rationed vital services the doctor i can t recall his name said that canada is rationing vital services as any physician can plainly see he said that a system in which people are refused treatment because they can t afford it is no different from a system in which people are refused treatment because the government can t afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health insurance plan in fairness he did say that both the us and canadian systems are in the same situation the ndp cleaning up a tory spending mess and just when i thought i understood canadian politics there was one about a group of doctors in calgary who have opened canada s first us style mri clinic as an alternative to the provincially owned one it s about time i ve ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they don t invest in their own private practices in the end it s their money but they choose to spend it on america s cup pipedreams and that s none of my business as for provincially owned for sure it s against the law in canada for governments to be directly involved in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser vations what that term actually means is that the facility gets by on public grants to meet shortfall from lack of use no kidding medical practice itself is much more conservative up north my own best friend did two clerkships at the mayo clinic in rochester mn and is no stranger to high tech medicine but his boat comes first there were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of two tiered health care and that it might violate the canada health act no it s probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have private practices and always have they can all take cash anyways so why not have a particular facility the canadian big government mentality often imagines government where it does not even exist the only potential problem i see with the private mri facilty in calgary is the self referral problem to the facility for the doctors who have a financial interest in it which is basically unethical but in canada because of our small population there is likely only to be a few private facilities involving only a small number of doctors and thus i don t think the self referral problem which is an epidemic in the us could ever get out of hand here look nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the mri nobody stopped them when they bought it nobody seems to be stopping them from using it either much ado about nothing thank goodness that hockey playoffs have started it is an experiment that will be certainly be watched carefully while it seemed currently unjustified there was one anecdote told by the head of the partnership to demonstrate the mri he showed an image of an injured knee which happened to belong to the manager of the bank who approved the loan he said that without it the guy might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial mri then another length of time for treatment after which the muscles would have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder if that isn t the first whiff of two tiers i don t know what is i m certain there is exaggeration somewhere because the gao study of canada cited often on usenet did not find access to mri to be a problem i ll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened to american trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit there are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without relying on mri unfortunately i ve had a few and i m not a banker what likely happened is the sponsors of the private mri which include doctors anticipated that alberta would need more mri s and instead of waiting for the health planners to realize they needed another one or two saw a business opportunity where they would have a secure business from the public insurance side of things and they could supplement people and businesses who want to pay

studies that showed that homosexuality among men is a lot higher so what can we deduce from these figures are there a lot less male homosexuals than there used to be or are men perhaps women too not as honest as they used to be about there sexuality presumably the people that were polled in you mean in the s men and women were much more open about their homosexuality than today want to try that one again this survey were assured of their anonymnity so they should have answered the questions honestly i suppose however it could be that gays feel so repressed and denigrated by society that they didn t feel that they could be forthcoming about there sexuality in something like a survey if this true then is it possible that there is a lot more gays out there than we are led to believe perhaps if americans were more open about there sexuality i think most americans aren t then we might discover that there are really quite a few more people out there who are orientated toward the same sex men and women included i d venture a guess that there is a lot of people out there who have considered having a relationship with someone of the same sex at some point in there life maybe they didn t take their longings seriously but this doesn t make these longings any less valid therefore if americans weren t so repressed about their sexuality in general as i believe they may be then we d see a lot more people coming out of the closet you mean ignore study after study so that we can continue to accept a study kinsey s that is obviously wrong as for myself i m a heterosexual and i ve never considered having sex with another man that s just the way i am i could have just as easily of been gay i suppose one of the big debates about homosexuality is whether or not it s a type of behavior that is learned or if one is just born that way imho the more likely explanation is that it s some combination of the two based on what besides your own warm fuzzy feelings here s something to ponder upon have any of you gay bashers out there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an intrinsic and natural part of their life as heterosexuals do about their own sexuality in other words someone who is truly alcoholics share that feeling until they hit bottom gay may not be able to live any other way even if they date someone of the opposite sex or get married in their heart they are still a homosexual likewise if someone who is truly heterosexual forms a relationship with someone of the same sex then they are still a heterosexual even though outward appearances may suggest otherwise scott kennedy brewer and patriot unless of course the problem is that homosexuality is a form of mental disorder caused by childhood sexual abuse as a number of recent works suggest if homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their morality on others antidiscrimination laws and leave our children alone i

good job then we let another farmer grow sorghum and you grow something else when people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the public holdings no one can sell land but they can trade places with anybody no one can lease land the government will locally distribute the use of the land not used for residences residences that are insufficient to the families living there can be traded

this number is consistent with kinsey pomery gebard bell weinberg and rice in the finding that of the male population is actively homosexual with an further breakdown bell wienberg of exclusively so and self identifying themselves as bisexuals pp as for debunking kinsey the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read was kinsey a fake and a pervert by philip nobile far out on the grassy knoll of sexology there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late alfred kinsey was a secret sex criminal a hoosier dr mengele who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids but what really riles these critics is kinsey s towerin cultural influence his bestselling surveys sexual behavior in the human male and sexual behavior in the human female tore the sheets off the country s erogenous zones and undermined midcentury morals his charts and graphs based on detailed histories of men and women demonstrated that practices generally considered rare and or abnormal masturbation extramarital relations homosexuality and even barnyard bestiality were as american as strawberry shortcake yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists aided and abetted by pat buchanan and the religious right the zoology professor from indiana university remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character assassination judith reisman the prosecution s expert witness at the mapplethorpe trial in cincinnati is the leader of the anti kinsey revisionists as well as his inspector javert in during a radio interview with pat buchanan in washington reisman accused kinsey of having been inolved in the vicious genital torture of hundreds of children she speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests now seven years later reisman has revived her charges in a different book titled kinsey sex and fraud just released by the small and religiously oriented huntington house in lafayette louisiana her coauthor is ed eichel a manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission the coital alignment technique that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the sexes in the book eichel contends that kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because being an oddball himself he wanted to advance the denormalization of heterosexuality if the authors are right then the world famous kinsey reports are as the introduction boldly asserts the most egregious example of scientific deception in this century and if they are wrong kinsey sex and fraud is a shameful smear despite the less than stellar credentials of kinsey s detractors legends are not what they used to be martin luther king may have committed plagiarism bruno bettelheim slapped young mental patients around father bruce ritter the founder of covenant house preyed on runaway boys closer to kinsey masters and johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or another so it should not surprise anybody that kinsey who filmed strange people having sex in his attic may have had skeletons in the closet the problem is that reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the job as a thinker the woman is no madame curie the year old former songwriter for captain kangaroo has little professional standing no current university position and no peer review publications though her creative resume was padded with phantom accomplishments for instance it listed a book as her own take back the night women on pornography that was actually written and edited by others then there is her ph d in speech communication from cleveland s case western reserve university although reisman has no bachelor s degree case granted her a master s in and a doctorate in her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian tv commentator but on the resume reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy hautes etudes moniker to wit the application of aristotelian and systems analytic theory to mass media effects when reisman burst into prominence on buchanan s program it was love at first sight for al regnery the outwardly anti porn head of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention in ed meese s justice department regnery was a young law and order conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the united states after reisman s sensational radio session the sexual equivalent of joe mccarthy s wheeling speech regnery summoned her to meetings to discuss mutual interests first he tried to shovel her for a quasi frankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing photographs guffaws on capitol hill killed the original proposal but in govemment money went to reisman anyway for plan b a probe of child images in the cartoons playboy penthouse and hust ler incredibly this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney general s pornography commission when the overpriced and oversold project was completed in it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed justice department that spring regnery resigned from his post only days before the new republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the house notwithstanding the six figure humiliation reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony right as the darling of the sex cranks she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in men s magazines and blames aids on gays kinsey sex and fraud is reisman s latest grasp for respectability pat buchanan of course is putting his krugerrands on reisman s ultimate vindication this book is social dynamite he says in a blurb an the front cover he especially liked the antigay parts smacking his lips in his syndicated column he declared it may just blow the sewer cap off kinsey s monumental reputation reestablish homosexuality as a in aberration expose the gay rights movement as a paper tiger and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon dr kinsey s research the blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive j accuse is that kinsey was a sex mad pedophile who molested little boys in nazi type experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume a similar charge was first recited at the fifth world conference on sexology in jerusalem in to no effect before being recycled by reisman for buchanan in washington in here is how reisman and eichel repackaged the mengele business in kinsey sex and fraud mengele like scientific experiments on infants and children were the basis for kinsey s conclusions on childhood sexuality somewhere and sometime in the course of the project kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost years this of course would implicate kinsey and his team in promoting and perhaps participating in the criminal activity in the opinion of this book s authors that is exactly how part of kinsey s child sexuality research took place donning his psychohistorian s cap and citing an fbi manual on child molesters as a guide eichel casually diagnoses kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as reisman said kinsey placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys such as y m c a camp counselor boys club leader and boy scout leader activities he kept up during his college and graduate yeaers and even after his marriage as crude as his analysis seems eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone interview if you ve ever been around boy lovers pedophiles they are absolutely compulsive he averred everything in his life is directed at getting children i didn t mention this in our book but the caption under kinsey s high school picture was a quote from hamlet man delights me not no sic nor woman neither what do you think they were picking up on before weighing what reisman and eichel pass off as proof of kinsey s sex crimes something must be said about kinsey s scientific modus operandi he was a fiendish collector as a young zoologist with a d sc from harvard he collected million gall wasps and million related insects when he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage course at indiana university in he was no less curious or acquisitive nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to him he compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral eroticism naturally the sexual response of children the genesis of eros fascinated him it was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their origins and so with the fervor of his bughunting days kinsey collected information about kids though even his worst enemies until reisman and eichel refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our disposal although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers he treated the documentary materia of the pedophiles as pure gold there was nothing like it in the literature kinsey s main source a year old govemment worker was also the most unforgettable character he had ever met this man whose history took hours to log had sex with over boys and girls as well as of family members including his father and grandmother a sexual hobbyist and passionate record keeper he gave kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent boys relying on the man s meticulous research which involved following some boys for as long as years kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release as well as the speed and the capacity of climax what freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality kinsey had reported as fact children were indeed erotic beings from the cradle these data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy he concluded without raising eyebrows in then along came judith reisman ignorng the legitimacy of kinsey s inquiry she beheld the ghost of mengele in bloomington she was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker and she dared to say that kinsey was a sex criminal well was he or wasn t he let s go to the text there is no evidence in kinsey sex and fraud no witnesses no paper noteven a trace of hearsay that implicates kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex experiments after years on the trail reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge amazingly enough kinsey himself and wardell pomeroy kinsey s coauthor on both reports to whom reisman has never spoken it turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in pomeroy s biography titled dr kinsey and the institute for sex research after frisking every the and and in both books reisman came up with what she believes are smoking sentences to establish kinsey s alleged role in the planning she says that there is a hint in the fifth chapter of the male volume that kinsey directed the orgasm studies on kids she cites his tell tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that writers test their theories by empirical study and statistical procedures then she combines this quote with kinsey s statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was involved putting two and two together kinsey s empiricism and lengthy experimentation she arrives at her hint but realizing this dog would not hunt she devoted but a single paragraph to kinsey s supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal involvement as for the alleged participation after poring over pomeroy s biography reisman found several hidden clues suggesting kinsey s likely hands on approach to kiddie sex here the chain of reasoning is more complex she points out that kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements collecting sperm and filming sex in his attic since kinsey did indeed mislead indiana university about the purpose of his cinematography he said that he was filming animal sex reisman asserts that a similar misrepresentation may yet apply to kinsey s child sex experiments catch the may reisman was also struck by kinsey s doubting thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits kinsey according to pomeroy was the type of person who needed to see things for himself pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit because he had not personally witnessed this event kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished scientist how then did kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a month old infant from the mere history of a sex offender but of course he did not he depended on their records from this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides sperm attic cumshots and climax in cottontail has reisman defamed the legendary kinsey paul gebhard succeeded kinsey as the director of the kinsey institute and now lives in retirement outside bloomington reached by telephone gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied reisman s nasty imputations i don t understand the resistance of people like reisman to studying the sexuality of children gebhard said more in exasperation than anger that is where sex begins we were happy to take data wherever we found it even though pedophiles commit criminal acts they are usually not violent folks they wouldn t be very successful if they were one of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students as for directing experiments that s absurd we never told any of our subjects what to do lt was against our principles almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective anyway nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children ourselves that would have been highly inappropriate i asked gebhard if kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual situation i think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and kinsey watched it as for kinsey s sex life it is still shrouded in confidentiality he was married to the same woman for years and fathered four children apparently there are no huge sexual revelations although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the years gebhard took his boss s history back in the s but he refuses to discuss what he knows we never divulge anything about anybody s history whether dead or alive he says reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that i had once worked for penthouse not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five years in keeping with our contentious history she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing the kinsey practice of euphemizing incest my offense was using the biblical variant lying with a near relative in a article on the subject of incest as a synonym for intercourse lying with appears eight times in genesis ed eichel is a different story though seemingly obsessed by kinsey like his coauthor he was friendly in long conversations he told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in new york university s human sexuality program in the early s it was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals he says around eichel came upon reisman s critique of kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in the sex establishment was ruled by a kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual norm no wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections eventually eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with reisman and from this union kinsey sex and fraud was born eichel s main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal uninhibited people which by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior would open the way for the second and more difficult step the ultimate goal of cross generational sex sex with children when i pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions he said weakly you don t think kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids but this is implicit in the kinsey reports meanwhile eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of kinsey and his data perfect that

tells me sixty police federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house kicked down the door cut locks off your gun safe i couldn t believe it then i walked inside what a nightmare it was no nightmare it was horribly real life apparently acting on information the lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm some thirty agents of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms batf teamed up with state and tulsa police authorities search warrant in hand to search for a colt ar caliber machine gun unknown serial number the warrant issued by u s magistrate john leo wagner also authorized agents to seize any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms such as files or drills documents papers books records and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched reports vary but according to neighbors the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some agents and local law enforcement personnel against lawmaster they cordoned off the street took station with weapons drawn in the back yard used a battering ram to break through the front door kicked in the back door broke into his gun safe threw personal papers around the house spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor broke into a small locked box that contained precious coins stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles breaking the table in the process then they left the doors were closed but not latched much less locked the ammo and guns were left unsecured my front and back doors were pulled shut but they were busted through and couldn t latch anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything i own a child could have taken a gun the guns the safe everything was open and laying around i keep all my magazines empty but someone had loaded them while i was looking around in amazement the gas electric and water companies show up to turn the power off they said they were told to shut things down then i found the note nothing found atf they didn t make any attempt to notify me i ve lived in tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket how come they can t look that up

straight i d never end up with a guy anyway as several people on soc bi pointed out to me this is true only if you find partners for relationships or just for sex in primarily straight circles nowadays with gay culture quite visible in major cities and such you can easily find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so choose about half my friends are bi and that s just from hanging out in the science fiction club and going to ucbu once a week it s not as if i have to go out of my way and hang out in bars or something so the available pool for dates can be the same size unless of course you re trying to date a random sample of the us population as for promiscuity i ve traded email with clayton on the topic and he still doesn t seem to want to admit that yes gay males are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they re closeted and can t afford to be seen in a permanent relationship or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed up gender roles in our society and when males are dating males and they ve all been trained to be the aggressor in sex there s going to be more sex or that what s dysfunctional what s screwed up is societal attitudes not gay sexuality and that s what encourages deviant behavior in gay males also note that just because someone s had sex partners doesn t mean they re promiscuous yes it sounds ridiculous but it s quite possible for someone to go through a heavily closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with strangers and then come out start forming real relationships and be

federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective a day standoff ensued the federal bureau of investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life the bureau s efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing david koresh was dangerous irrational and probably insane he engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency he was moreover responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in february given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi designed to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it was hoped force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender i was informed of the plan to end the siege i discussed it with attorney general reno i asked the questions i thought it was appropriate for me to ask i then told her to do what she thought was right and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday s action ended in a horrible human tragedy mr koresh s response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive he killed those he controlled and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued now we must review the past with an eye towards the future i have directed the united stated departments of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why and whether anything could have been done differently i have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation i expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review finally i have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances again i want to say as i did yesterday i am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in waco i hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks and i hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now q mr president can you first of all tell us why after days you decided q mr president can you describe for us what it is that janet reno outlined to you in your minute phone conversation with the president i can t hear you both if one will go first and then the other q sorry can you describe what janet reno q mr president the president i ll answer both your questions but i can t do it at once q can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it the president yes i was told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound and she described generally what the operation would be that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building and it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside i was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon they were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire in fact as you know an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials there were no shots coming back from the government side i asked a number of questions the first question i asked is why now we have waited seven weeks why now the reasons i was given were the following number one that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there they might be needed in other parts of the country number two that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult members to come out number three that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time and number four that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions so for those reasons they wanted to move at that time the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good she said that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time the third question i asked was has the military been consulted as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco that s the first thing i asked to be done because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation military people were then brought in helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it and so i asked if the military had been consulted the attorney general said that they had and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance having asked those questions and gotten those answers i said that if she thought it was the right thing to do that she should proceed and that i would support it and i stand by that today q mr president the president wait go ahead q can you address the widespread perception reported widely television radio and newspapers that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster the president no i m bewildered by it the only reason i made no public statement yesterday let me say the only reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold there was i have i can t account for why people speculated one way or the other but i talked to the attorney general on the day before the action took place i talked to her yesterday i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry king show and i talked to her again this morning a president it is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control i will say this however i was frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves applause i regret what happened but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance these people killed four federal officials in the line of duty they were heavily armed they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly and they were never fired back on we did everything we could to avoid the loss of life they made the decision to immolate themselves and i regret it terribly and i feel awful about the children but in the end the last comment i had from janet reno is when and i talked to her on sunday i said now i want you to tell me once more why you believe not why they believe why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she said it s because of the children they have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they re in increasingly unsafe conditions and that they don t think it will get any easier with time with the passage of time i have to take their word for that so that is where i think things stand q can we assume then that you don t think this was mishandled in view of the outcome that you didn t run out of patience and if you had it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no well i think what you can assume is just exactly what i announced today this is a the fbi has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety split record time we want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way is there something else we should have known is there some other question they should have asked is there some other question i should have asked can i say for sure that no one that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different i don t know that that s why i want the inquiry and that s why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non political outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have there is unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world and we may have to confront it again and i want to know whether there is anything we can do particularly when there are children involved but i do think it is important to recognize that the wrong doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves q mr president were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from february th until yesterday the president well yes i got regular reports all along the way there were lots of other options pursued if you go back you all covered it very well the fbi you did a very good job of it i mean the fbi and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way and a lot of them early on seemed to be working some of the children got out some of the other people left there was a at one point there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the authorities and then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward whether there were other in terms of what happened yesterday the conversation i had with the attorney general did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing because they said they wanted to do this because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves that s what they thought q did the government know that the children did not have gas masks q congressional hearings once the situation are you in agreement with that the president that s up to the congress they can do whatever they want but i think it s very important that the treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts and as i said in my statement if any congressional committees want to look into it we will fully cooperate there is nothing to hide here this was probably the most well covered operation of its kind in the history of the country go ahead sarah q there are two questions i want to ask you the first is i think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did so the children had no chance because this gas was very she said it was not lethal but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks and on february th let s go back didn t those people have a right to practice their religion the president they were not just practicing their religion they were the treasury department believed that they had violated federal laws any number of them q what federal laws the president let me go back and answer i can t answer the question about the gas masks except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested they were convinced that it wouldn t kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside and one of the things that i ve heard i don t want to get into the details of this because i don t know but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn t have the desired effect they also knew sarah that there was an underground compound a bus buried underground where the children could be sent and they were i think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected in terms of the gas masks themselves i learned yesterday i did not ask this fact question before that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work so that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent nonshooting circumstance ms myers last question q mr president why are you still saying that q could you tell us whether or not you ever asked janet reno about the possibility of a mass suicide and when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments the president what i asked janet reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen and she said and of course the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public he had that had been debated anyway and she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future that was the judgment they made whether they were right or wrong of course we will never know what happened when i saw the fire when i saw the building burning i was sick i felt terrible and my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside trying to burn themselves up that s the first thing i wanted to know thank you q mr president why are you still saying it was a janet reno decision isn t it in the end your decision the president well what i m saying is that i didn t have a four or five hour detailed briefing from the fbi i didn t go over every strategic part of it it is a decision for which i take responsibility i m the president of the united states and i signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call when i talked to her on sunday some time had elapsed she might have made a decision to change her mind i said if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow i will support you and i do support her she is not ultimately responsible to the american people i am but i think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation i think as well as she could have thank you applause end p m edt\n",

pdb ipl jpl nasa gov paul bartholomew writes a very well put together post i disagree with several key points but the post is an excellent one with which to engage in discourse there has been much discussion recently about the right to freedom of association mr cramer and mr ronzone appear to take an absolutist position on this right that it is a fundamental human right perhaps the fundamental human right and that it supersedes other rights such as the right to an equal opportunity others feel that a right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and thus we have the never ending debate that flares up repeatedly freedom of association foa involves the mutual and voluntary agreement of two or more people right to equal opportunity lets call it reo involves coercion in all cases by definition a major problem is that neither of these rights are explicitly declared or protected in the constitution or in the declaration of independence although both can be derived from these documents unfortunately this means that the debate will never end because neither side can conclu sively prove the validity of their view it becomes solely a matter of personal philosophy yes there is much debate but no it can end with once and for all recognition of these rights well not totally perfect end but end in the same way that there is no worldwide disagreement that say murder is a crime my personal opinion is that the real answer lies somewhere in between i regard both of these rights as fundamental human rights which unfortu nately come into direct conflict with one another which is stronger depends on the given situation hmm there is even more discusion about religion should we take a somewhere in between approach towards the state a state recognized religion the first amendment is so uh so absolutist you know for example if the owner of a mom and pop store wishes to hire an employee to help out their right to freedom of association outweighs the rights of their job applicants to an equal opportunity they should be free to hire whomever they choose using whatever criteria they choose without any government intervention at all similarly if a family wishes to rent out a bedroom in their home or a garage apartment or something similar then their right to freedom of association outweighs the rights of their prospective tenants to an equal opportunity if on the other hand ibm a multi national corporation with employees publicly owned and operated by a board of directors wishes to hire additional employees then whose freedom of association are we protecting the board of directors the other employees the owners of the stock in this case the applicant s right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and we as a society can ask ibm to use only those criteria which are relevant to the specific task why says who why can mon pop have foa but ibm be forced and force is the correct word here to have reo as purchase of ibm is voluntary then there are very well defined procedures on how ibm chooses to do some things and chooses to do other things why not let those same procedures work for employment policies similarly if a landlord owns a number of apartment buildings in which he does not live and which are managed by an independent management agency then whose freedom of association are we protecting if the owner does not live in his buildings and has no contact with his tenants then the prospective tenant s right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and we as a society can ask the owner to use only those criteria which are relevant to good tenants i ve put good in quotation marks because i really don t want to be drawn off into the side issue of what constitutes a good tenant why does this tenant have an option i won t call it a right to destroy the foa of the landlord if the landlord and the tenant can t agree then they both can cease from using each other s property suddenly by arm waving by magic a landlord does not have foa and on what basis does the foa of the landlord disappear it seems that vague terms like no contact with tenants suffice well i think foa is one our most important rightts in the top and by golly if the state is going to make it suffer i sure would like to see the heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right i don t think no contact with the tenats is even a crime much less something that should cause severe interference with important rights i suspect that the majority of the people in this country agree with my position on these extreme cases particularly if they are presented in this manner i don t know if mr ronzone or mr cramer would agree i suspect not in any case additional problems arise when we try to apply guidelines for the middle ground what if the company has employees or or where do we draw the line between protecting the right to freedom of association and protecting the right to an equal opportunity rights are not defined by majority mob choice foa is an absolute reo is a fancy name for thuggery for racism and coercion the difficulty is that any line we draw will of necessity be artificial and any legislation resulting will be flawed in the past the government has usually tried to pass laws which referred to the number of employees hired by the company e g any company with more than xxx employees was affected by the law those with fewer were unaffected of course it would be you dimly see that the line must be artifiacial because foa is the only right just like a state religion you can t jsutify that either generally i believe that if we do not have any regulations affecting these rights then the right to freedom of association will be stronger on the other hand many of the regulations protect the right to an equal opportunity too much weakening the right to freedom of association i don t believe there is a satisfactory solution which will please everybody a solution that i came up with is to use publicly owned vs privately owned as the dividing line if the company remains privately owned then the owners should be free to do whatever they want with their company if the company becomes publicly owned then the public has a right to ask the company to submit to additional regulation why i assume that when you say publicly owned you are talking about those quasi state companys that do not have shareholders the companies on the fortune for example are all privately owned they can give you a list of all of their owners they have no anonymous unknown to them owners by the way the above analysis is based on the assumption that the right to freedom of association and the right to an equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal importance since this is entirely a matter of faith not subject to any proof i do not choose to even try to establish this you either accept it or you don t any comments foa can be derived by any two rational people on a basis that neither has evil malicious or murderous intent towards the others in short agreement is mutual or not at all your reo on the other hand lives only by accepting coercion the gun into the situation and that is self destructive of the whole argument because it is based only on might makes right sort of like saying nobody has a right to live whereupon i whip out a gun and shoot you dead end of argument there are actually people that still believe love canal was some kind of environmental disaster weird eh

isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for exemptions and one e mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verified for me that it is indeed negative option i guess that you can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance but so far i ve not come across that up north and i take pains to keep tabs with news from home it s optional but what if you don t want basic coverage on the government s terms you said before that if you opt out you re basically uninsured there are two things at work here the public insurance is very wide in what it will cover as the amortization is also universal no private plan can boast of a plan that fits a gaussian curve and as our private sector has discovered they re better off not offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use and that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an effective cartel they don t really need to compete because as you put it they re in a win win situation and they re guaranteed to turn a profit believe me they probably had orgasms when they figured that out and according to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to the point of ungraciousness at chamber of commerce luncheons so in a sense they ve stopped being truly capitalists if they don t have to worry about competing anymore you might say that the total effect is one of socialized medicine a government providing the basics and a cartel providing the extras there is no alternative to the system desirable or not the alternative to the system is no system at all patients opted out doctors opted out or both but that only for insurance and you can t force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they will not offer and remember that the actual health care is delivered by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily again they can t force a private entity to spring to life to pay them plus there is the matter of culture and values i m basically anti tax and anti government by canadian standards yet i can t bring myself to make the same arguments as you do despite that i understand where you re coming from up north you re so much more likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage interesting side note have any new insurance companies started up from scratch since medicare became standard in canada i actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since ww i no scratch that there are a few in western canada and quite a few in quebec as part of the post quebec miracle out with the nationalism in with the french capitalism la groupe des cooper antes built a new tower by the eaton s store at les terraces and if you were able to catch urban angel on cbs s crimetime you d see it as the well lit one with double turrets at the top as for ontario which still dominates and anchors business up north i meant new companies not new buildings yes primarily in quebec and in alberta sorry i musta lost you in that verbose blurb it s not really insurance if you don t have alternatives well you have to realize that in our society that s like saying that it s not really national defence because you can t hire your own rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist true but i would be more comfortable with a system in which basic care provided by the government was optional not mandatory in canada and germany it s not mandatory however it is negative option in that you must request the exemption that the private sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option as in the quebec case tells me something about what they know either way the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp in the light of disasters e g chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart disease a doctor needs years of training plus internship and specialty training another problem with the us system that should be resolved doesn t canada have something like ten times the proportion of gps to specialists that the us does yes but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are too small to sustain many specialists sometimes not even one so you pretty well have to be a gp to get paid and if you do get the training the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a licence because there is already someone in the business and who cannot fill his her appointment book that we have a cma doctors monopoly is something that the american ama oriented medical lobby never tells you down here the problem is in a specialty your skill often directly correlates to your pay a good cardiologist makes more than a merely adequate cardiologist more than it does in general practice in that circumstance it s hard to blame people for going into specialties no i respect people who do specialties okay all of my md friends are but there s the question of our small market dynamics up north if anything that our private doctors and hospitals sell their services to americans to generate more business will inflate their effective population served and thus make some specialties finally viable i e there will be enough customers we just do not have enough sick canadians in absolute numbers otherwise i personally think an approach like germany s would be best where the companies compete for batches of people rochester a little east of us was able to get almost all of its population covered that way uh germany basically uses our method with their many sickness funds the competition is fake if it exists at all because they re all interlinked look in der spiegel or stern my girlfriend is in our german department and her uncle is a private practicioner in saarbrucken no ads for health insurance while canada organizes by province germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations and regional offices but remember that we have provinces that have the same population as some major german corporations germans have public health insurance just that it is brokered by smaller entities actually brokerage of basic by private firms who ll sell extra insurance to fill out their policies sort of a voucher system was one of the first ideas floated in canada too remember the germans don t have hmo s a telling sign cos rochester does and they re also a company town but there was a washington post article recently about that that said canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of mris which require spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches mickey kaus in the new republic probably spoke for most americans when he said who needs that i think people here generally like to believe they can easily get the most high tech treatment even if they really can t afford it i ll have to let a canadian md jump in to verify that claim but i ve come to learn to suspect anything in the american press about our system if much or some of it were true you d have to take us for idiots for tolerating it and given that our insurance was installed during a period when there were only liberal and tory governments federally and provincially and the socialists are still chafing they would ve pressed for real socialized medicine to fix things think about it after all we are using the

they can t force a private entity to spring to life to pay them so the government by sheer economic force has basically cleared the basic care market for itself the only way to test this would be for some really daring person to start up from scratch in alberta and or quebec a health insurance company offering basic care crazy yes but that s almost how mci got started however the concept of risks is well known by insurance actuaries and no private firm can get the kind of amortization that the public pools can get and since health insurance gets spent that doesn t sit well with the insurance ceo s and you get a situation like in the u s where rates keep going up to catch up see what i mean it s a government monopoly sure because it s a non market phenomenom and the free market can t solve it even our private insurance says that and remember last year quebec proposed giving the least risky parts of basic care to the private sector and they balked like you said why should they and wants no part of it by your own arguments if you don t want the provincial plan you re basically up a creek yes but in our culture arguing against it is like arguing for national defence by means of warlords true according to polls i ve read usually in the sort of simpleminded stuff you were initally responding to something like of americans would like canadian style health care whereas only of canadians would like it our way i d be interested to know why there are that many of canada s population is about a million or so people canada is saturated by american media while pundits come on cable and talk about how awful our health care is supposed to be what people experience up north ends up not differing from what they see portrayed on american television in movies i e same infrastructure different insurance make up yet they know not of any insurance problems and have no idea of what an hmo is but having lots of british tv as well they know that they don t like nhs someone must have a reason to argue against it valid or not what kind of people are they the polls that you refer to for the canadian data are from the annual july st polls conducted for macleans our major english newsmagazine by decima research decima president allen gregg is considered one of the world s top poll researchers and mulroney s conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations the american polls are harris polls and have been reposted on usenet a few times and probably will again i m sorta suspicious myself cos maybe americans want universal coverage like canada i honestly doubt that most americans realize that we have private doctors and public and private hospitals i e similiar health care infrastructure and our system is basically pure insurance without hmo s given recent turnarounds by the hiaa endorsing universal coverage and hostility to corporatist hmo s within the ama and the complete silence vis a vis canada bashing by the ama i suspect that they re keeping the secret about canada up their sleeve exactly wouldn t you until the idea of managed competition arose there was no direct threat to stand alone private practice in the s the ama fought hmo s as corporatized socialist medicine part of the reason why we have only insurance and no hmo s in canada cos that was part of the deal cut with the cma i ve also read that the three biggest american hmos can be compared straight up against some of the smaller canadian provinces in the maritimes and they spend something like less per patient maybe it does help the american hmo s can still cream and they probably cover a smaller geographic area than even our smallest provinces geography again some of them are spread out across the whole country i think but each site is probably compact and the clientele are creamed and don t forget that hmo s place caps on your coverage and often won t tell you about additional procedures you could get

scant rational basis for that fear so insane seems to describe any such belief what is the penalty if convicted of murdering federal agents in texas the death penalty none of which excuses the

than the average for private insurance companies versus if you have any evidence that blue cross bears a heavier burden in insuring government employees than private employees post it otherwise try to stick to factual assertions and as the original post implied it is private insurers in the us whose administrative costs are significantly higher than the administrative costs of tax supported health care systems in canada and elsewhere only those that remain paper bound and refuse to standardize well now that s an interesting defense of the free enterprise system are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents private insurance companies from standardizing in fact it is true that some of the red tape burden stems from the lack of standardization among the or so private insurers in the us but it s a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than free enterprise at work by the way barron s the bible of wall street this week admitted that administrative

not justify shooting first without identifying oneself the atf and fbi have done this before so don t say they haven t please or producing a warrant guess it depends on whose story one believes huh it took them days to think of a basic terrorist tactic i e tear gas and this could only be justified in support of rescuing any supposed hostages inside the govt has a right to use lethal force in certain cases attempts to capture dangerous criminals who are armed and threatening the lives of others which others are we talking about here is one in this case they used sub lethal force sub lethal excuse me but those people are dead the gov t immediately imprisoned these so called hostages the children were held hostage evidence so far the fbi has produced none don t hold your breath the adults were wanted variously for murder and conspiracy to murder only a few of those being held in chains and s hackles are wanted the rest are being held for the crime of being material witnesses it took hundreds of gov t agents with tax funded cellular phones ten minutes to dial for the fire department they should not have called the fire dept at all there was no role for them to play in a situation where those that might be rescued might well shoot at them it was not the feds decision to make but the firefighters calling the fire dept meant that waco was deprived of a resource that might have been needed elsewhere should a situation where it could have been used arisen this is true of any answer to a call for help from a fire department by any citizen since fire departments do answer calls that deprive resources that might be needed elsewhere it is not a valid reason for not calling them further since the davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in a court of law they are subject to the same protection as any other citizen and las far as i know even criminals in prison are not left to burn to death in a fire by cutting off the water supply in the surrounding area the gov t guaranteed that any fire at the compound would be fatal any fire started deliberately uising lamp oil is likely to be fatal i guess this is a matter of religious faith with you the government says it so it must be so or haven t you been reading this thread well enough to notice that some of us here don t beleive their story no one had the foresight to station rescue vehicles nearby in the first place they are a scarce resource a bunch of psychos cannot deprive the neighbourhood of a resource that might be required in a genuine case patients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires either besides as i explained some of us here believe their distress might have been genuine are you so certain it wasn t the gov t conveniently forgot all that freedom of religion stuff freedom of religion does not include human sacrifice nor does it include other forms of murder there is no evidence that the davidians committed human sacrifice either before of after the initial raid and self defense is not murder the gov t arguably started or at least fanned the fire themselves the govt arguably is run by communists or the trilateral commission he did not say it was deliberate accidents do not require conspiracy theories only wanton disregard for human life the initial raid alone agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce ment procedure proves they did not mind killing people finally and this may be a stretch for some of you statists out there but koresh s original reasons for holing up in such a compound may have something to do with the continual interference from the gov t new taxes new regulations and increasing involvement in every aspect of our personal and economic lives life on a compound might become the way of the future it might have to be let us hope that those who support koresh are not allowed to enforce this upon the rest of us no one here is supporting koresh we are opposing the illegal use of excessive violence by our government against our citizens that is all their reasons for supporting the ownership of high power weaponry are clear enough they hope that this will be the catylist for the destruction of the fabric of society and allow them to enforce their nightmare vision of the future a society that believes it is ok to terrorize people for their religious views will destroy itself in due time it is the feds who disrupted the fabric of society in waco not koresh it is the feds who forced a nightmare onto the people of mount carmel it would be a good thing for people to study history on what basis do you assume we haven t don t you really mean it would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from history that i do in particular a group of militant militant implies acts of aggression against one s neighbors the davidians left their neighbors alone religious heretics who left to set up such a community some time ago a few years latter they had captured medina and destroyed the idols in the kabba within ten years the whole of arabia was under islam so what the mormons were considered a cult for years and were chased out of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are advocating when they finally got to set up a community they left people alone so far americans haven t been put to the sword by mormon hordes crying to avenge joseph smith just because a group of people start by saying that all they want is to be left alone does not mean that that is how they will stay it doesn t mean they won t either anyway the whole purpose of a system of laws is to

federal authorities why does the general consensus appear to be that they the bd were insane is it the manner of their behaviour before they died or the fact they chose to kill themselves rather than submit to the government i ask this question because there is a tradition and one that is highly regarded by many people that several hundred jews elected to throw themselves off a cliff at masada rather than submit to roman rule the circumstances at masada and those at waco would seem in general terms quite similar and yet so far as i m aware nobody has seriously suggested that the jews were insane the point of this comparison is to question the use of the word cult in discussing the events at waco why were the davidians a cult and not the jews at masada what constitutes a cult is it the size of the membership or a matter of respectability or perhaps the length of time it s been in existence are the catholics a cult how about the mormons or the calvinists is a sect a respectible cult dictionary definitions aside since popular usage seems to carry more weight i suspect that the word cult is used in a perjorive sense when speaking of groups like the davidians it is rather like the word boss when used to describe someone unpopular or someone the government wishes to make unpopular like say castro the communist boss of cuba one doesn t hear clinton described as america s democratic or capitalist boss well for one thing most if not all the dividians depending on whether they could show they acted in self defense and there were no illegal weapons could have gone on with their life as they were living it no one was forcing them to give up their religion or even their legal weapons the dividians had survived a change in leadership before so even if koresch himself would have been convicted and sent to jail they still could have carried on i don t think the dividians were insane but i don t see a reason for mass suicide if the fire was intentional set by some of

given that the trade in illegal drugs is responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation there is much evidence that it is the fact that the drugs are illegal not the drugs themselves that have caused the violence witness prohibition and the violence that surrounded the trade in alcohol no joke people who want drugs particularly people who are predisposed to addiction will find a way to get them whether or not they are legally available this is suppossed to be an argument for keeping drugs illegal no you jumped to that conclusion it s actually an argument as to how to accomplish the societal good of discouraging drug use without violating individual rights despite current law enforcement efforts drugs are readily available to those who want them this is suppossed to be an argument for keeping drugs illegal no you missed the point the point is the war on drugs is a failure and is counterproductive addiction to drugs boh legal and illegal is responsible for a significant drain on the productive resources of our country and this occurs in a variety of ways from the cocaine addicted babies who are unable to learn to the spread of disease among addicts to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking the crack baby scenario has been thouroughly discredited it just so happens that the symptoms seen in the crack babies are identical to fetal alcohol syndrome and the mothers who admitted to taking crack also admitted to drinking heavily during pregnancy in this country people are free to be stupid if they want to but they are not free to be stupid and injure other people admittedly the fetal right to life is outside the scope of this discussion however it s ridiculous to assert as you apparently do that cocaine has no effect on the developing fetal nervous system caffiene and nicotine have fetal effects too why should cocaine be any exception a general economic principle of government is that whatever is subsidized you get more of and whatever is taxed you get less of to be most effective in confronting the nation s drug problem some way must be found to utilize these additional powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use less attractive so make the drugs legal tax them and use the tax money to fund a program to tell people how studid drugs are it has worked for the legal drugs if you had read my article before writing your knee jerk response you would have seen that this is exactly what i advocated while this country s current efforts to combat legal drugs have succeeded in some respects there is a greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking and designated driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving for example the same cannot be said for the war on illegal drugs there remains a core group of illegal drug users which support international networks of smugglers pushers growers processors kingpins and gangsters these networks and their marketing activities which include drive by shootings corrupting law enforcement authorities and smuggling weapons are directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed in our country every day each and every one of these problems is a direct result of the drug trade being illegal no shit sherlock clearly illegal drugs and rising crime are linked it takes only a moment s reflection to recognize how they are linked the link is money as with this country s failed effort to prohibit alcohol consumption a black market has been created in which greedy local monopolies like the gangsters of a bygone era have profited enormously from their illegal trade the victims of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire but i would argue the drug users themselves a great argument for making drugs legal thank you how could you have missed the point so utterly what have you been smoking here then is my proposal possession and use of all presently illegal drugs is decriminalized but buying and selling them remains illegal potheads can grow their own marijuana as many already do today other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops your solution has done nothing to eliminate the violence in the drug trade btw how is someone going to import a drug if buying it is illegal i think you need to think your solution through a little more thouroughly obviously importers will not be buying drugs in the u s under u s jurisdiction use your remaining brain cells because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle if these drugs can be obtained for free or next to nothing why buy them nevertheless there will be those who will seek to sell these noncommercial drugs even at relatively low prices therefore you have failed to indicate how these drugs can be obtained for free or next to nothing you have stated that the sale of them is illegal o k i ll spell it out for you barter economy means that drug users will be permitted to grow or synthesize chemically anything they choose or to buy it outside the u s and bring it in if it won t grow here they will also be permitted to trade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they themselves grow or manufacture they will not however be able to legally sell their drugs for money both manufacture and importation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed to discourage their use this is your brain on drugs any questions law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices but here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers the victimizers and the drug users their victims in most cities this is already the strategy it has already failed and is dragging the rest of us down with it pardon me but possession use of these drugs is still a crime you cannot analogize the rates at which drug users would seek treatment and the comparative ease with which it could be made available today when these drugs are illegal to possess use with what it would be were they not illegal to possess use decriminalizing possession and use makes treatment much easier drug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses of those persons who are prone to addiction and as such the drug users should be left alone not thrown in prison along with their victimizers drug dealers are the criminals and should be treated as such drug addiction does not absolve you of responsiblity for your criminal actions however upon arrest for any crime suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of if they are found to be a drug user they will be institutionalized until they are clean and only then will they begin to serve their sentence if they choose to cooperate and are already drug free they can begin to serve their sentence right away those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences this sounds a hell of a lot like self incrimination which is unconstitutional if drug use is legal in your scheme why should the presence of drugs in anyones system influence the penalty they receive much too big brotherish for my tastes the drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary not coerced and does not therefore constitute violation of amendment v those convicted who are drug users as evidenced by the test are in need of treatment for their problem institutionalization of these adddicted criminals is i would argue the best way to help them straighten out if they refuse the test and are convicted their sentence can be appropriately harsher since they unlike the addict have no excuse for their crimes institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes drug using criminals and this includes drunk and or stoned drivers are separated from their sources of supply thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business why should drug using criminals be treated any different from other criminals you have already stated that drug use is legal mark wilson atlantaga ncr com why not my objective is to discourage drug use and criminal behavior if fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a harsher sentence if they are convicted why is that not a good thing if fewer drug dealers who are still criminals btw can find victims why is that not a good thing if fewer drug users such as drunks potheads etc commit crimes out of fear of being cut off from their sources of supply why is that not a good thing i m certainly willing to debate my

the law that poor tortured paragraph has got to be one of the most unfortunate passages in the english language witness the legions of blowhards like yourself who think those vague flowery phrases are part of the law of the land do you really believe that a politician only has to give lip service to promoting the general welfare to be within the limits of the constitution sorry buddy but some other blowhards managed to include the general welfare in another portion of the constitution article i section the congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes to pay the debts and provide for

do a little experiment what if the constitution read as follows preamble we the people to promote the general welfare do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america constitution the federal government shall have one function and one function only to provide for the defense of the nation the government would not then have two functions defense and welfare but

congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts indebtedness as defined in the document and provide for the common defence defence as precisely defined and general welfare as defined through the document mostly in ways that limit the government of the united states but the above taxes shall be uniform through out the u s so far the congress

vaclav havel there will be a photo op at the top of that meeting no formal press conference afterwards any questions q is he moving towards some major decision this week on bosnia ms myers as we ve said he s continuing to discuss his options he s been talking extensively with his foreign policy advisors his bosnia advisors as well as with other world leaders he ll try to contact president mitterrand again today and he ll continue to discuss it we don t have any specific timetable but obviously the situation there is very serious q has he called janet reno today or yesterday ms myers i don t believe he s spoken to her today q why does he have nothing to say about this publicly except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at p m ms myers he did he answered a question about it yesterday q before anything had happened ms myers before anything happened he put out q since something has happened he s had nothing to say ms myers he s put out a statement on it last night and we ll have more to say about it later today q in what forum is that going to be ms myers it will be at the photo in the rose garden q he will talk about waco at that ms myers yes he ll have something to say q is that something we can take live ms myers i think it will be brief we can talk a little later about the exact structure as we work it out but i don t know if it s something you d want to take live q will he take questions on waco at that time as well ms myers he ll probably take a few q is there any reason why he hasn t talked to the attorney general ms myers i ll have to double check i don t know that he hasn t talked to her this morning q and she didn t come here this morning to see him or anyone else ms myers no q and he didn t talk yesterday q what s the reaction to her resignation statement that she made last night ms myers she was asked a question about it and she answered the question the president has absolutely no intention of asking for the attorney general s resignation he stands behind her percent as you know he was informed about the decision he takes full responsibility for that and stands percent behind attorney general reno q the question now arises yesterday we were told that he was briefed on this but we never got a firm idea of how much he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and the justification of the timing was he fully informed on all of that all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the compound that made them want to go now the feeling that nothing else was going to succeed et cetera ms myers he talked with the attorney general about the decision about she talked to him about the factors that led to her decision he raised no objections he supports her decision to go forward with it he was fully briefed q of course hindsight is but looking back now does the president does the white house feel that the decision he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at what actually happened ms myers i think everybody feels bad when life is lost but i don t think that that is reason to second guess the decision he stands behind the decision that was made he was informed about it he was fully briefed about it and he stands percent behind the attorney general the justice department and the fbi it s a difficult operation and there s it had already gone on for more than seven weeks four federal agents had lost their lives in the line of duty let s not forget that this was a very difficult situation and all the decisions involved were very difficult but all the agents on the ground the fbi the justice department all recommended moving forward with this they thought given the circumstances it was the best possible course of action there s just no point in second guessing those decisions now i think that there s a reason q why not they have to ms myers no not to second guess the decisions i think it s important to take a look at it to have an investigation i think the president will talk some about that later today but at this from this vantage point to second guess those decisions it s not useful q you sound like he s going to order an investigation of what happened and whether ms myers i think he ll have more to say about that later yes q he will order an investigation ms myers he ll have more yes he ll have more to say about an investigation q what kind of investigation ms myers he ll have more to say about it later q but in the monday morning quarterbacking surely there is some soul searching now as to whether it was the right decision you can t say that we did the best we could when it turned out to be a rather a debacle ms myers i think we ll obviously we ll review the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome i don t think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic but again the president stands behind the decisions that were made and we ll take a look at the factors that contributed to that q what was the fbi director s role in this ms myers well he was obviously involved in setting up the operation he signed off on it as did the agents that were on the ground that were working with him i don t believe he spoke to the president but i ll double check that q but he was very closely involved in every aspect of planning and so forth ms myers i would refer you to the fbi on exactly what aspects he was involved with q will janet reno be coming over to the white house today ms myers there s no planned meeting i don t believe that she ll be here q she won t be at this event at p m ms myers no no plans to be q do you think that there s going to be a jumping on on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in terms of to the president s detriment politically ms myers well i would certainly hope that people wouldn t try to use this tragedy for political reasons obviously i think again that it s useful to look at the facts to reevaluate the facts and i think the president will move forward with that but i think people understand that this was a difficult series of decisions that it was a very difficult situation that it was caused by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four federal agents and i think it s most tragic that a lot of innocent children lost their lives in this i don t think anybody disputes the tragedy of the outcome q dee dee what was the white house role in handling the i guess public relations aspect in the aftermath who was talking who here at the white house was talking with people at justice to set up reno s news conference to do all that sort of thing ms myers i think the attorney general handled her end of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the news conference once there was a point at which there was enough information i think to talk with some accuracy about what had transpired during the day obviously people here at a number of levels were keeping in touch with people at the justice department and at the fbi to try to keep informed about what was happening there q but reno said that she didn t talk to the president and there seemed to be an indication she hadn t talked to anybody at the white house so who ms myers there were people talking on a staff to staff level q i understand but who at the justice department was handling that for reno who was talking to the white house ms myers there were a number of people as you know webb hubbell is the liaison to the white house and i know he talked to a number of people here there were a number of people at a number of different levels involved i don t want to get into exactly who had what conversations with whom but there were a number of conversations obviously the justice department was working to keep the white house informed the press informed to the best of its ability as events unfolded throughout the day q did webb hubbell talk to the president ms myers i don t believe so i don t know if he talked he may have at one point q and was the white house role just to seek information about what happened or was it to direct the public information campaign that followed ms myers it was both to keep abreast of the situation so the president could be on top of it but i think the justice department managed its press relations on it we were obviously very interested in what was happening there throughout the day and the president was following it very closely throughout the day q dee dee on that though if the president was following it so closely and he had talked the night before with janet reno why wouldn t he talk to her at all since then ms myers again i don t know if he s talked to her this morning again he s kept fully aware of what has been going on throughout the day he stands percent behind her decisions he s been fully supportive of her as he said yesterday morning before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written statement q but wouldn t he want to convey those thoughts to her personally yesterday ms myers one more time i don t know if they ve spoken this morning q no yesterday q clearly there s a perception that she was left hung out to dry all day yesterday ms myers that s just not true i think we said throughout the day that the president takes full responsibility that he stands i don t know how much clearer we can be the president stands foursquare behind the attorney general on this he accepts full responsibility for the events that transpired he believes that janet reno the justice department and the fbi acted as best they could given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the time i don t know what else he can say to show that he supports her percent q one of the best indications of that is to pick up the phone and tell her ms myers again i don t know whether they ve spoken this morning q why can t we find out ms myers well we can i can t do it standing here right now q you ve got six people here all they ve got to do is pick up the phone ms myers helen we ll get back to you q dee dee when the president spoke with the attorney general on sunday is it safe to assume that either she volunteered or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to increasing pressure on the davidians ms myers i think that they discussed the situation again i m not going to get into the specific details of what exactly she told him but i think that he was aware of the risks involved q dee dee the president yesterday morning said it was entirely her decision she then said that she told him what was happening and he said okay does the president regard it that he gave the go ahead or that she gave the go ahead ms myers i think what they both said yesterday was that she made a decision based on all the available facts she informed him about that and he raised no objections again i don t know how much clearer we can be about that q and he said okay the issue is over the responsibility ms myers he said okay q does okay mean ms myers the president accepts ultimate responsibility q dee dee the president s investigation that he s going to announce would that be conducted by someone outside the administration ms myers no q it would be internal is it meant to preclude any congressional investigation ms myers no it s meant simply to follow up on the incidents that occurred yesterday q and you would i assume therefore cooperate fully with any congressional hearings that would be held ms myers to the best of our ability q dee dee there are two reports out this morning one that the justice department or fbi or whomever apparently had a bug planted inside the complex and the other is that the children may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire what do you know about those two ms myers nothing more than i ve seen in news accounts this morning we may get more on it later but at this point i know i m not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by people who came out of the compound q has the president received any report today in terms of fatalities and actually what was going on what they ve been able to find out on in the compound now ms myers he s been briefed i don t think that they ve gotten into the compound yet they were still waiting for it to cool off i don t think there s much beyond what s been reported in the news accounts but he has been kept up to date on it q dee dee the president stands behind attorney general reno but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from the so called experts ms myers he believes that she made he stands behind the decision that she made it was the unanimous decision of her advisors of the fbi of the agents on the ground and he supports that q what about the validity of the decisions made on the ground does he back those ms myers he s not going to second guess decisions made q dee dee you just said he stands behind the decision which she made normally in a situation like this the president says i made the decision but you re saying she made the decision ms myers i m saying that the president was briefed about the decision he okayed it and he accepts full responsibility for it q but then why do you keep using the terminology the decision that she made rather than the decision that he made ms myers because as he said yesterday she evaluated the facts based on evidence presented to her by justice department and fbi which is part of the justice department and made a decision and then briefed the president on that decision that is how the chain of command works she briefed him he signed off on it the operation went forward and the president accepts full responsibility q in that chain of command analogy there i want to go back to sessions a moment do you know if this was a plan that came through him to reno or was it presented to her around him or with his involvement what was his involvement ms myers again you d have to go to the justice department for the specific interaction between the attorney general and the director q does the president stand behind director sessions ms myers he supports again i don t know how many different ways i can say this he supports the decisions made by the justice department and the fbi he fully supports the attorney general in this i m not stepping away from the director of the fbi i want to but janet reno is the one who briefed him the one who made the decisions as the head of the justice department as you know the director of the fbi reports to the attorney general the attorney general made the decision she informed the president about those decisions he okayed it he didn t raise any objections to it and he accepts full responsibility q do you have based on what you know here at the white house any concerns about william sessions performance during this ms myers nothing to suggest that no q along those same lines just in your initial review of the situation how much do you think the problems might have come from not having a justice department that s fully staffed and having an fbi director who is still quite uncertain about his status ms myers i just don t think that had anything to do with it i think the agents on the ground the operation went forward i m not going to speculate on that q did the white house express any alarm that janet reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to speak to clinton ms myers no she was carrying forward her responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday i think she did a very admirable job the president agrees with that q before sunday how often was the president briefed on the situation in waco ms myers he was kept updated on a regular basis on a daily basis q who briefed the president ms myers well i m not going to get into exactly who what conversations he had with whom but he was kept up to date on the events in waco he has daily briefings on a number of issues q no no was this a regular briefing conducted by a white house staff person or was it by a justice department person ms myers he s briefed regularly by a white house staff on a number of issues again i m not going to get into exactly who briefs him on what subjects q another subject q on another subject q now we re going to do gays in the military laughter ms myers i welcome it q how close are you to signing the biodiversity treaty ms myers as you know the president s giving a speech on earth day tomorrow we ll have more to say about it then q any details on where or when that speech is yet ms myers it s at a m and i don t know where yet q dee dee is this a major policy address how would you characterize the speech tomorrow ms myers i would characterize it as a earth day speech i wouldn t look for any major departures from his past positions on these things but again i don t want to get too much into what he s going to talk about tomorrow q on or off campus q is this at a location outside the white house ms myers it will be somewhere in washington we don t know exactly where yet q dee dee what foreign leaders has the president talked to since friday on the situation in bosnia ms myers only prime minister major and again he ll try to reach president mitterrand again this morning q david owen said yesterday and joe biden said today both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work that the serbs are not going to sign on does the administration still believe that it can work and that they will sign on ms myers obviously the ultimate goal is some sort of peaceful resolution to the conflict in bosnia as you know the administration is considering a wide variety of options at this point the situation there in and around srebrenica and the rest of eastern bosnia is quite serious and the president will meet with his bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this q is that a question they re going to try to be deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable ms myers again they ll be reviewing a number of options including the peace plan q does the group that he s meeting with today include reg bartholomew ms myers i don t believe he s here but it will be among the usual secretary christopher secretary aspin general powell q dee dee do you have anything on the apparent encounter by u s f s over bosnia today some aircraft violating the no fly zone ms myers no i don t i ll get back to you on that q will the president be meeting with every one of the leaders coming to town for the holocaust museum ms myers he will he ll be meeting as you know with vaclav havel today and with lech walesa tomorrow and then with the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon q as a group or one by one ms myers i believe it s as a group now havel and walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for quite some time but he will meet with all of the foreign heads of state that are here q dee dee has the president decided whether he supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act and has anything been worked out for him to address the march on sunday ms myers i think he ll probably have a letter or some kind of a statement to the march we haven t worked out the exact details of that q not a live phone hook up ms myers probably not given the logistics of getting to boston the speech as you know is at p m the answer to the other part of your question is no he hasn t taken a position on it q you said that speech in boston was at p m ms myers i believe so yes q do you know what it s on ms myers we ll still working out q general vessey s coming back tonight from vietnam when will he be meeting with the president ms myers no specific meeting is scheduled we ll talk to him at some point and see we look forward to his report but exactly how he ll make that report is unclear q so he s not going to come immediately to the white house ms myers no q the aids czar how close are you ms myers still working on it q drug czar q do you expect it before the march ms myers i don t have a time line on it q did the president ask senator mitchell to try the lloyd cutler ploy to break the filibuster ms myers i don t believe so q why not ms myers he s just not going to q are senate democrats here at this hour ms myers no that s tomorrow tomorrow at a m q update on the stimulus possible scaling down ms myers as you know the senate will vote on amendments today we ll continue to talk the president is committed to some kind of a jobs package we d like to see it passed and we ll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where we end up q when this briefing is over can you give us word through the speaker or whatever whether the president s talked to janet reno ms myers we ll be happy to q it s become a pressing question for the last several hours ms myers no just this minute that i ve been here and i haven t had a chance to follow up on it helen q does he have an opinion on hatfield ms myers i mean obviously he prefers he offered a compromise package of billion he believes that that s the best alternative believes that he s obviously willing to take a second look at the package and i think the senate will vote on that today and we re hopeful that the president s bill which will be the mitchell amendment will be the one that will be approved q dee dee is there any white house official that will be at the march on sunday ms myers somebody will be there representing the president i don t know who yet q well has it been decided how he s going to address is it going to be a videotape or a phone call ms myers i think it will probably be a letter but there hasn t been a final decision on that yet q the official will read the letter is that what it sounds like ms myers correct q lloyd bentsen came in here this morning do you know what was that about was that about this waco thing ms myers no actually it wasn t it may have come up but it was about economic issues q on health care is the th of may still the target ms myers that s still the target q and there s talk about a joint session of congress speech at the end of may ms myers we haven t resolved exactly how the president will present the health care plan to the people i wouldn t rule that out as an

venomous this was getting be careful here the problem isn t the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich rich but the values and systems that make the rich rich all basically amount to freedom of choice in new england in the entire economy was based on the small family farm farm economy households were economically diversified producing not only agricultural goods but also manufactured goods especially cloth many farm women carded spun and or wove producing not only cloth for their own family but also to sell generating extra income but about this time the industrial revolution was underway in england and by the s it had moved to the us in both cases in the form of textile mills these mills could produce cloth far more efficiently and cheaply than people at home the result was that an important source of home income was wiped out and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to go to work in these same mills in lowell mass or nashua nh where they worked hour weeks in deafening dangerous conditions living regimented lives and being exposed to cotton dust and infectious dis eases due to the work now people didn t have to buy the cheaper factory made cloth they were free to keep buying the home made variety and support their local economy things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system and make money everything else we care about goes to shit but sorry for the cliche it takes two to tango the big rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff it used to be the case that the business center of a town was also its social center you knew the merchants you did business with or even local kids working behind the counter you would see people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of thousands or millions you have no particular relationship with the companies you do business with and feel no particular commitment to them nor they to you major components of what defines a com munity have been destroyed on the other hand the products we buy at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign manufacture and they are probably of better or at least more consistent quality i have to constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make money money doesn t make us happy it just prevents certain things making us more unhappy therefore don t shoot the rich shoot the conservatives don t blame the conservatives for this everyone makes their own individual choice and the liberals and the fence sitters are just as guilty of pretending there are no social and cultural consequences to economic

hagerstown the press plane will leave from washington he will meet with some q what kind of a plane is that he s taking ms myers that he s taking he ll probably take a c q from hagerstown ms myers from hagerstown air force one doesn t fly out of hagerstown apparently q how will the pool travel ms myers the pool will have to meet him ahead of time so i guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait for him at the airport there is currently no provision and i ll double check because there s currently no provision i think that s standard operating practice q the pool is not going to meet him and watch him get on the plane at hagerstown ms myers i don t believe so q what time does he have to be in boston ms myers he s going to meet there with a group of citizens mostly people who supported us during the campaign at around p m we re still working out the final times q at the airport ms myers no it will be at the boston harbor hotel and then he will also meet with some a youth group that authored something called project the speech to the publishers is actually at p m it will be followed by q a and then after the speech and q a he ll attend a reception with the publishers and then return to washington from boston and that s it for the weekend q has the president seen the report from or the letter communication from the foreign service officers also obviously the communication from madeleine albright and what is his reaction to their call on him ms myers well obviously the letter was written to secretary christopher i believe secretary christopher received the letter on saturday he reviewed it and met with the authors on monday to discuss their views he believes it s an important part of the policy making process and is taking their views into account as we go forward in the development of the bosnia policy q what is the president s reaction ms myers the president hasn t seen the letter it was something that was directed towards secretary christopher in terms of he hasn t seen specifically the letter but in terms of their concerns generally what the president has said is that there are a lot of options on the table now including ones that weren t there before and i think he s as is everybody gravely concerned about the situation in bosnia q is he influenced by that i mean how does he feel about the fact that all of the specialists in that area those desk officers ms myers many of the specialists in that area i think that that is clearly part of the process it s something their views will clearly be considered i think secretary christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views i think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that those opinions ought to be considered particularly from people who work closely on the issues q what do you mean there are options on the table that weren t there before ms myers i think the president said last week that there were options such as lifting the arms embargo to the bosnian muslims that had been previously off the table that are now being considered q dee dee in terms of those options madeleine albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action by the u s if the europeans did not go along is that on the table ms myers well i can t discuss anything that would any conversations that would have happened between ambassador albright and the president but i think the president has said he would certainly is working with our european allies he s had a number of conversations with european leaders and is trying to build some consensus there q will he reach a decision will he have anything specific to say today ms myers no i mean in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today q does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action ms myers he s continuing to consult with our allies at this point he has said i think he s been fairly clear about it that the he believes that the u s needs to act in concert with its allies on this q on that point does he believe that the u s though does have built in authority from the united nations already to take unilateral action ms myers well i think the u n resolution makes it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort i think the broader point is that anything we do any options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is consistent with u n authority and if it s not we ll work with our allies to make sure that we get it q dee dee then how does the white house someone as distinguished as elie wiesel who says that not enough is being done to stop the atrocities going on in bosnia ms myers i think that that s why we re considering additional options i think that mr wiesel s comments yesterday were quite compelling the situation in bosnia is tragic the president is very concerned about it he has i think president clinton has worked very hard to take further actions to continue to isolate serbia in the world community clearly we re considering other options because the president is concerned that perhaps it s not enough q in terms of what you were just talking about it sounds like resolution justifies unilateral action by the u s to protect humanitarian ms myers i don t think it i wouldn t use the word justify it permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian relief but i think that s just an explanation of the resolution i think any action that we take will be consistent with u n resolutions or we ll work with our allies to make sure that it is permissible or we ll get further action q the president and other officials have ruled out unilateral u s action in bosnia in the past you re declining to do that this morning ms myers no i said the president has said repeatedly that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this q that doesn t mean that he won t act alone which has been said before explicitly ms myers i don t mean to imply a change in policy the president has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this q one other little question did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers ms myers i don t believe so secretary christopher they may have had a private conversation about it the president has not seen it q they met on monday right christopher met surely he must have brought that up ms myers again they may have talked privately about it but q dee dee what you re saying is that the albright recommendation has been rejected is that correct ms myers no i didn t say that at all i said i won t i said i wouldn t comment on any conversations or communications q she s advocating unilateral action and you re saying in effect that we will not take unilateral action ms myers i am not confirming anything that madeleine albright may or may not have recommended q given the sometimes delicate complicated and frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue does the president find this kind of letter from foreign service officers of the state department helpful to that process hurtful to that ms myers i think that their views are obviously being considered the secretary received that memo on saturday and two days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing of their views of the basis for their views to discuss in greater detail the options that they had presented in the letter q doesn t it put some kind of pressure on additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the allies may or may not do ms myers i think clearly there s a broad policy review underway now and the president and his advisors are considering a number of options including some of those outlined in the letter from the folks over at the state department now no decisions have been made on that yet but i think that there is a through review underway and that their opinions are being very seriously considered q if i can just follow up i guess what i m looking for is what was his reaction to this letter did he say good this bolsters my position or did he say damn this is just what i don t need right now ms myers i think he said this helps contribute substantively to the debate it s important that all views be considered and aired thoroughly that before he makes a decision he wants to have the best possible advice and information possible and this i think in many ways furthers that goal q so internal advice to a cabinet official or the president it s all open now and you wouldn t take any umbrage or say that they were out of line ms myers i think that the fact that secretary christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is conclusive evidence that their views are welcome q does the policy review include what madeleine albright has suggested and what joe biden and others have suggested which is that the previous u n resolutions authorize unilateral action military action for the delivery of humanitarian ms myers i think all options are on the table q the unilateral option is on the table ms myers i think all options are on the table q we ve had two different q isn t that a change dee dee q that would be a change of policy q particularly if it includes ground troops which has been specifically ruled out ms myers i think the president has been well no i don t that is not q are you talking about all options ms myers all options i think the president has been fairly clear about that so let me just review again what he has said he has said that the president has said all options are on the table with the exception of the introduction of ground troops which he has never suggested he has ruled that out from the beginning q hasn t he ruled out unilateral action of any sort ms myers he has said that he doesn t believe the u s can solve the problems in the former yugoslavia by itself i think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right now i don t think that again i don t want to comment on specific options that are being considered other than in the broad categories that we ve already said things like lifting the arms embargo against the bosnian muslims things that i think we ve talked about in broad terms this is a very complicated situation the options being presented and considered are very complicated q air strikes on the table ms myers again i think that s been fairly clearly pointed out that that s something that s being discussed q dee dee are ground troops on the ms myers no ground troops are not being considered q you said there was not going to be you said you were not announcing a change of policy then you said everything is on the table we re confused are unilateral actions on the table ms myers all i can tell you is what the president has said that he doesn t believe that he wants to act in concert with the allies on this q wants to but he s willing to i mean if they don t go along ms myers he s continuing to consult with our allies on this he s continuing to have discussions he s continuing to press them for further action and i think that s clear the conversation is ongoing we re going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this q dee dee the allies have taken the position that to conduct any kind of air strikes in bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid that they feel that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the bosnians ms myers i m not sure that s the consistent i mean i m not sure who you re referring to q the british and the french q yes the british and french they ve taken the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strikes against the bosnian military does the u s believe differently from that ms myers the president has had conversations with both mitterrand and major as you know i think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well and i don t want to comment on the nature of the president s discussions other than to say that he s continuing to consult with our allies as we move forward and he s continuing to press them for further action and i think that process is ongoing q the other day voted against any military intervention yesterday does the president regard that as the end of the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of unilateral action the allies have been very very plain that they do not want to do anything ms myers the consultations are ongoing that s all i can tell you at this point q are you saying that there won t be any announcement on bosnia today in the press conference ms myers no that is not the intention of the press conference q what is the intention ms myers it s an opportunity to take questions he may have a brief i m sure he ll have a brief opening statement but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on bosnia that will not happen q can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is ms myers it s sort of a general statement of where we are q after the first hundred days you mean ms myers it s not a long statement i mean this is just generally don t look for any major policy pronouncements q do you know what the opening statement is ms myers but it s perhaps later today i ll be able to tell you with more certainty i think that s still under review but the overriding purpose of this it s not a mystery it s not meant to be it s just to take questions q it would be helpful to know whether what the opening statement is on ms myers since the major purpose here is just to take questions it s not completely resolved yet q dee dee one policy that was expected last week and that the white house you and george seemed to indicate we might get would be an aids czar will he announce that today and what s the delay on that ms myers i don t think we meant to imply i think we said it would happen soon i don t think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week it is coming soon i don t anticipate that happening today q what s the delay isn t this the perfect time to announce an aids czar ms myers i don t know that it s a delay i think the process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background checks and to make sure that we ve crossed the t s and dotted the i s before we make an announcement q dee dee what are zoe baird s qualifications for the foreign intelligence advisory board and why wasn t her appointment announced here ms myers the qualifications i don t know if there s a specific list i ll have to check and see i think there are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government service i think there s a broad variety of views across political spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there we never made a formal announcement other than the chairman of the board which is admiral william crowe q why would he appoint her though if the american people and many in the senate rejected her for another government job ms myers i don t believe that the american people ever had voted on her and i certainly she was never rejected in the senate she never went up there for a hearing but the president believes she s a very competent person he s said that zoe baird do you understand what the question is zoe baird is on the president s foreign intelligence q you said she never went up there for a hearing q her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws ms myers right she never she was never but you said she was rejected by the senate i was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the senate q so you don t think that is any problem ms myers i don t think there s any problem q she has been appointed to this board is that a fact ms myers yes q does she need confirmation for this does she need confirmation to be a member of the ms myers no it s a presidential appointment q usually announcements are made here at the white house was there a decision not to announce her publicly ms myers we didn t make an announcement people who asked were told who the members of the board were we didn t make an official announcement if anybody s interested in that we can certainly put out the list of names q i d like to know q don t such board members don t you normally as a matter of routinely put out releases on all these boards and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension ms myers not always but again i m happy to put this out q isn t that the standard practice q that was past practice ms myers again i m happy to put it out we ll put out a list of the members of the board today q dee dee i don t want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but laughter all i really want to know is hasn t it been the practice in this administration for such announcements to be made routinely ms myers i think generally but not always and we re happy to put that out today q what is the board what is her title what is the size of the board ms myers there is roughly a dozen members on the board it is a civilian board although their are some obviously retired military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the president again the chairman of that board is admiral william crowe q and did he recommend baird q what s the name of the board ms myers it s the president s foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab q what s her qualification that she had employed an illegal alien is that laughter ms myers do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke q let me phrase it another way why shouldn t this appointment be viewed as a pay back for the difficulty she had a couple of months ago ms myers because it s not q what s her experience in foreign intelligence ms myers she s an experienced attorney someone who the president believes is very competent and qualified and i think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input not everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert that is not the board s mission it is to provide civilian input for the president as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters he believes she s very qualified very competent person enormously talented and has said that throughout q is this just a figment of my overactive imagination or was there discussion early on about abolishing the president s foreign intelligence advisory board ms myers i don t think so on december th when he announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he would had appointed admiral crowe as the head of the board so i don t believe there s ever been any q earlier than that during the transition ms myers no i don t believe so it was announced again on december th admiral crowe couldn t be there but it was announced q are members paid ms myers i don t believe so but i ll double check q on another subject on waco how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the bodies that are coming out of waco and the state i guess it s the texas ranger reports ms myers most of the information is coming the federal information is coming from the site clearly there s been some discrepancies and the justice department is looking into it officials in the justice department were told i believe the day before yesterday that there were several bodies found with bullet holes i think there s some discrepancy about that and the justice department is looking into it q is the president going to get involved in trying to sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down there with some people withdrawing others saying they re in charge but others justice fbi texas rangers all grabbing a piece of this ms myers i don t know that he s going to try to mediate the dispute i mean i ll let you know if there s anything he intends to do about it but as you know there are several levels of investigation ongoing and we re hopeful that they can work together q is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything ms myers i don t know i ll have to get back to you on that q what is the subject matter of sunday s speech ms myers it s going to be fairly general i don t think it s going to be any specific announcements i think it s going to be sort of a q does he have a topic that he s going to talk about ms myers we re still working on it but i wouldn t look for any announcements of like the drug czar or something like that q is it sort of a days speech sort of my excellent adventure for days laughter ms myers not exactly but i think he ll take a little bit broader look about what s happened in the last q foreign domestic ms myers a little bit of both but i think a lot of domestic q and overview ms myers yes more of an overview than a specific policy announcement q has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the president will address the gay rights march on sunday ms myers it will be a

conference by the president the east room p m edt the president terry do you have a question q mr president there s a growing feeling that the western response to bloodshed in bosnia has been woefully inadequate holocaust survivor elie wiesel asked you yesterday to do something anything to stop the fighting is the united states considering taking unilateral action such as air strikes against serb artillery sites the president well first let me say as you know for more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for further action and i want to say too let s look at the last three months since i became president i have worked with our allies and we have tried to move forward first on the no fly zone on enforcement of it on the humanitarian airdrops on the war crimes investigation on getting the bosnian muslims involved in the peace process we have made some progress and now we have a very much tougher sanctions resolution and leon fuerth who is the national security advisor to the vice president is in europe now working on implementing that that is going to make a big difference to serbia and we are reviewing other options i think we should act we should lead the united states should lead we have led for the last three months we have moved the coalition and to be fair our allies in europe have been willing to do their part and they have troops on the ground there but i do not think we should act alone unilaterally nor do i think we will have to and in the next several days i think we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and which has taken a lot of my time as well as the time of the administration as it should have over the last days or so i think we ll finish that in the near future and then we ll have a policy and we ll announce it and everybody can evaluate it q can i follow up the president sure q do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in bosnia and the holocaust the president i think the holocaust is on a whole different level i think it is without precedent or peer in human history on the other hand ethnic cleansing is the kind of inhumanity that the holocaust took to the nth degree the idea of moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing and it is especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic groups live side by side for so long together and i think you have to stand up against it i think it s wrong we were talking today about all of the other troubles in that region i was happy to see the violence between the croats and the muslims in bosnia subside this morning and i think we re making progress on that front but what s going on with the serbians and the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other conflicts both within the former yugoslavia and in other parts of the region q mr president by any count you have not had a good week in your presidency the tragedy in waco the defeat of your stimulus bill the standoff in bosnia what did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently how do you look at things are you reassessing laughter the president i don t really believe that the situation in bosnia it s not been a good week for the world but i don t know that the administration could have made it different on the stimulus package i d like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in this days we have already fundamentally changed the direction of an american government we have abandoned trickle down economics we ve abandoned the policies that brought the debt of this country from trillion to trillion in only a decade the budget plan which passed the congress which will reduce the deficit and increase investment has led to a year low in mortgage rates dramatically lower interest rates there are probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages in the last three months or who have had access to cheaper credit that s going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this economy in ways that are very very good for the country and so we are moving in the right direction economically i regret that the stimulus did not pass and i have begun to ask and will continue to ask not only people in the administration but people in the congress whether there is something i could have done differently to pass that part of the reason it didn t pass was politics part of it was a difference in ideas there are really people still who believe that it s not needed i just disagree with that i think the recovery the economists say it s been underway for about two years and we ve still had months of seven percent unemployment and all the wealthy countries are having trouble creating jobs so i think there was an idea base an argument there that while we re waiting for the lower interest rates and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years to take effect this sort of supplemental appropriation should go forward now i have to tell you i did misgauge that because a majority of the republican senators now sitting in the senate voted for a similar stimulus when ronald reagan was president in and voted times for regular supplemental appropriations like this i just misgauged it and i hope that i can learn something i ve just been here days and you know i was a governor working with a contentious legislature for years and it took me a decade to get political reform there so it takes time to change things but i basically feel very good about what s happened in the first days with regard to the congress q waco the president well with regard to waco i don t have much to add to what i ve already said i think it is a i want the situation looked into i want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on that i think it s very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone over but i still maintain what i said from the beginning that the offender there was david koresh and i do not think the united states government is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves and i m sorry that they killed their children q mr president to follow up partly on helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to capitol hill ross perot said today that you re playing games with the american people in your tax policy he was strongly critical of your stimulus package he said he s going to launch an advertising campaign against the north american free trade agreement how are you going to handle his political criticism will it complicate your efforts on the hill with your economic plan and do you plan to repackage some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the hill the president let me answer that question first we re going to revisit all of that over the next few days i m going to be talking to members of congress and to others to see what we can do about that with regard to the economic plan i must say i found that rather amazing i don t want to get into an argument with mr perot i ll be interested to hear what his specifics are but i would go back and read his book and his plan there s a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy but otherwise the plans are remarkably similar so i think it would be i ll be interested to see if maybe perhaps he s changed his position from his book last year and he has some new ideas to bring to bear i ll be glad to hear them q to follow up sir how do you plan to handle his political criticism he s launched a campaign against you do you think you can sit back and just the president well first of all i will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me and if he s changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last year then we need to know why and what his ideas are maybe he s got some constructive ideas i think the american people have shown that they re very impatient with people who don t want to produce results and the one thing i think that everybody has figured out about me in the last even if they don t agree with what i do is that i want to get something done i just came here to try to change things i want to do things and i want to do things that help people s lives so my judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good that is constructive that takes us beyond some idea i ve proposed that will change people s lives for the better fine but i think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this debate and not just to the president q mr president to go back to bosnia for a minute you continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action a criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of paralysis the united states is the last remaining superpower why is it not appropriate in this situation for the united states to act unilaterally the president well the united states surely you would agree that the united states even as the last remaining superpower has to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the united nations q but you have a mandate and the president they do and that is one of the things that we have under review i haven t ruled out any option for action i would remind all of you i have not ruled out any option except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the introduction of american forces into continuing hostilities there we are not so we are reviewing other options but i also would remind you that to be fair our allies have had the french the british and the canadians have had troops on the ground there they have been justifiably worried about those but they have supported the airdrops the toughening of the sanctions they welcomed the american delegation now in europe working on how to make these sanctions really work and really bite against serbia and i can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position and i would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where we have been i don t have any criticism of the british the french and others about that q would that be military action q mr president several of the leading lights in your administration ranging from your fbi director to your u n ambassador to your deputy budget director to your health services secretary have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you ve taken in your administration why is that are you losing your political grip the president give me an example q example judge sessions said that there was no child abuse in waco madeleine albright has said in this morning s newspapers at least that she favors air strikes in bosnia all of these are things you said that you didn t support the president first of all i don t know what we know that david koresh had sex with children i think that is undisputed is it not is it not does anybody dispute that where i come from that qualifies as child abuse and we know that he had people teaching these kids how to kill themselves i think that qualifies as abuse and i m not criticizing judge sessions because i don t know exactly what he said in terms of madeleine albright madeleine albright has made no public statement at all about air strikes there is a press report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed her or memo in which she expressed her views about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior members of my administration to let me know what they thought we ought to do next and i have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do next and i m not going to discuss the recommendations they made to me but in the next few days when i make a decision about what to do then i will announce what i m going to do so i wouldn t say that either one of those examples qualifies speaking out of school q how about the value added tax mr president the president what was that q the value added tax mrs rivlin and miss shalala both said that they thought that that was a good idea the president i don t mind them saying they think it s a good idea there are all kinds of arguments for it on policy grounds that does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it in the health care debate no decision has been made on that and i have no objection to their expressing their views on that we ve had a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they thought that tax would help make their particular industries more competitive in the global economy i took no that wasn t taking a line against an administration policy q mr president a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed in the most ringing terms their confidence in your understanding of them and their political aspirations and their belief that you would fulfill those aspirations do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations the president well i don t know about that and i don t know what their it depends on what the expectations are but i ll tell you this i believe that this country s policies should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination i believe when you tell people they can t do certain things in this country that other people can do there ought to be an overwhelming and compelling reason for it i believe we need the services of all of our people and i have said that consistently and not as a political proposition the first time this issue came up was in when i was in boston i was just asked the question about it and i might add it s interesting that i have been attacked obviously those who disagree with me here are primarily coming from the political right in america when i was governor i was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards i just have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the rights of american individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their capacities and i m going to stick right with that q are you concerned sir that you may have generated expectations on their end and criticism among others that has hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis on this issue the president yes but i have not placed a great deal of emphasis on it it s gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters and in the press i ve just simply taken my position and tried to see it through and that s what i do it doesn t take a lot of my time as president to say what i believe in and what i intend to do and that s what i ll continue to do q mr president getting back to the situation in bosnia and we understand you haven t made any final decisions on new options previously considered unacceptable but the two most commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable the bosnian muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited air strikes perhaps to cut off supply lines without telling us your decision presumably you haven t made any final decisions on those two options what are the pros and cons that are going through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision the president i m reluctant to get into this there are those are two of the options there are some other options that have been considered all have pluses and minuses all have supporters and opponents within the administration and in the congress where i would remind you heavy consultations will be required to embark on any new policy i do believe that on the air strike issue the pronouncements that general powell has made generally about military action apply there if you take action if the united states takes action we must have a clearly defined objective that can be met we must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear the united states is not should not become involved as a partisan in a war with regard to the lifting of the arms embargo the question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace will it lead to more bloodshed what kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy but i think both of them deserve some serious consideration along with some other options we have q do you think that these people who are trying to get us into war in bosnia are really remembering that we haven t taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and we couldn t take care of our prisoners and get them all home from vietnam and now many of them are coming up with bills for treatment of agent orange how can we afford to go to any more of these wars the president well i think that s a good argument against the united states itself becoming involved as a belligerent in a war there but we are after all the world s only super power we do have to lead the world and there is a very serious problem of systematic ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia which could have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences and goodness knows there have been many but also could have other practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts of ethnic tensions exist q did you make any kind of agreement with boris yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive action against the serbs until after sunday and in general how has his political situation affected your deliberation on bosnia the president no i have not made any agreement and he did not ask for that we never even discussed that interestingly enough the russians i would remind you in the middle of president yeltsin s campaign abstained from our attempt to get tougher sanctions through the united nations in what i thought was the proper decision for them and one that the united states and i m sure the rest of the free world very much appreciated q do you wish mr president that you d become more involved in the planning of the waco operation and how would you handle that situation differently now the president i don t think as a practical matter that the president should become involved in the planning of those kinds of things at that detail one of the things that i m sure will come out when we look into this is the questions will be asked and answered did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten and i look forward to that but at the time i have to say as i did before the first thing i did after the atf agents were killed once we knew that the fbi was going to go in was to ask that the military be consulted because of the quasi as least military nature of the conflict given the resources that koresh had in his compound and their obvious willingness to use them and then on the day before the action i asked the questions of the attorney general which i have reported to you previously and which at the time i thought were sufficient i have as i said i m sure i leave it to others to make the suggestions about whether there are other questions i should have asked q mr president what is your assessment of director sessions role in the waco affair and have you made a decision on his future and if you haven t will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide the president well first of all i have no assessment of his role since i had no direct contact with him and i mean no negative or positive inference i have no assessment there i stand by what i said before about my general high regard for the fbi and i m waiting for a recommendation from the attorney general about what to do with the direction of the fbi q mr president since you said that one side in bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the holocaust carried to the nth degree why do you then tell us that the united states cannot take a partisan view in this war the president well i said that the principle of ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against that does not mean that the united states or the united nations can enter a war in effect to redraw the lines geographical lines of republics within what was yugoslavia or that that would ultimately be successful i think what the united states has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleansing and that is obviously the difficulty we are wrestling with this is clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face and that all of our allies face and if it were easy i suppose it would have been solved before we have tried to do more in the last days than was previously done it has clearly not been enough to stop the serbian aggression and we are now looking at what else we can do q yesterday you specifically criticized the roosevelt administration for not having bombed the railroads to the concentration camps and things that were near military targets aren t there steps like that that would not involve conflict direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider the president there may be i would remind you that the circumstances were somewhat different we were then at war with germany at the time and that s what made that whole incident so series of incidents so perplexing but we have as i say we ve got all of our options under review q the diplomatic initiative on haiti is on the verge of collapse what can you do to salvage it short of a full scale military operation the president well you may know something i don t that s not what our people tell me i think mr caputo and ambassador pezzullo have done together a good job the thing keeps going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the de facto government there it s obvious what their concerns are they were the same concerns that led to the ouster of aristide in the first place and president aristide we feel should be restored to power we re working toward that i get a report on that we discuss it at least three times a week and i m convinced that we re going to prevail there and be successful i do believe that there s every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of ongoing civilized society but i believe we re going to prevail there q mr president would you care to make your assessment of the first days before we make one for you laughter the president well i ll say if i believe first of all we passed the budget resolution in record time that was the biggest issue that confirmed the direction of the administration and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment and that we could do it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes almost all of which come from the highest income people in this society reversing a year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the middle class whose incomes were going down when their taxes were going up while the deficit went from trillion to trillion the total national debt and the deficit continued to go up we have a year low in interest rates from mortgages we have lower interest rates across the board we have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their debt we have established a new environmental policy which is dramatically different the secretary of education has worked with me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach in education that focuses on tough standards as well as increasing opportunity we have done an enormous amount of work on political reform on campaign finance and lobbying reform and i have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own administration s officials these things are consistent with not only what i said i d do in the campaign but with turning the country around the vice president is heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens of this country we are working on a whole range of other things the welfare reform initiative to move people from welfare to work and of course a massive amount of work has been done on the health care issue which is a huge economic and personal security problem for millions of americans so i think it is amazing how much has been done more will be done we also passed the family leave bill a version of the motor voter bill that has not come out of conference back to me yet and everything has been passed except the stimulus program so i think we re doing fine and we re moving in the right direction i feel good about it q sir a follow up wouldn t you say though that one of your biggest initiatives aid to soviet russia is now practically finished if we can t pass a stimulus bill in our own country how can we do it for them the president let me recast the question a little bit it s a good question laughter it s a good question but to be fair we ve got to recast it we have already the first round of aid to the soviet to non soviet russia to a democratic russia is plainly going to go through the first billion the aid that we agreed with our partners in the g to provide through the international financial institutions which is a big dollar item is plainly going to go through the question is can we get any more aid for russia that requires a new appropriation by the united states congress and that is a question i think mary that will be resolved in the weeks ahead in part by what happens to the american workers and their jobs and their future i think the two things will be tied by many members of congress q the tailhook report came out this morning documenting horrendous and nearly criminal conduct on the part of the navy how much did you discuss the incident and what might be done about it with your nominee to be the secretary of the navy the president first let me comment a little on that the inspector general s report details conduct which is wrong and which has no place in the armed services and i expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate way i also want to say to the american people and to all of you that the report should be taken for what it is a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to be thoroughly examined it should not be taken as a general indictment of the united states navy or of all the fine people who serve there it is very specific in its allegations and it will be pursued the only thing i said to the secretary designate of the navy and the only thing i should have said to him i think is that i expected him to take the report and to do his duty and i believe he will do that q mr president to back to russia for just a minute the latest poll show that mr yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence but there seems to be a real toss up on whether or not voters are going to endorse his economic reforms the president i understand that q can you live with a split laughter can you live with a split decision though or do you need both passed in order to then build support for russian aid the president i believe the answer to your question is for the united states the key question should be that which is posed to any democracy which is who wins the election if he wins the election if he is ratified by the russian people to continue as their president then i think we should do our best to work with him toward reform you know we had a lot of other countries here for the holocaust museum dedication their leaders were here leaders from eastern europe leaders from at least one republic of the former soviet union all of them having terrible economic challenges as they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there s economic slowdown everywhere and in a world in which there s economic slowdown and difficulty all leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll because they haven t produced the results that the people so earnestly yearn for you can understand that but if they have confidence in the leadership i think that s all we can ask and the united states will if the russian people ratify him as their president and stick with him then the united states will continue to work with him i think he is a genuine democrat small d and genuinely committed to reform i think that we should support that q mr president mr perot has come out strongly in what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement nafta how hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplished the president i think we ll have the agreement ready in the fairly near future you know our people are still working with the mexican government and with the canadians on the side agreements we re trying to work out what the environmental agreement will say what the labor agreement will say and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement is the mexicans say and there is some merit to their position that they re worried about transferring their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral commission even in the united states to be fair we have some folks who are worried about that about giving that up on the other hand if we re going to have an environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means something then there has to be ultimately some consequences for violating them so what we re trying to do is to agree on an approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations if you keep on violating it past a certain point maybe not an isolated incident but a pattern of violation there is going to be some enforcement there must be consequences and we re working out the details of that but i still feel quite good about it and this is just an area where i disagree with mr perot and with others i think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more closely the mexican economy and the american economy and leads us from there to chile to other market economies in latin america and gives us a bigger world in which to trade i think that s the only way a rich country can grow richer if you look at what japan and other countries in the pacific are doing to reach out in their own region it s a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry about how to build those bridges in our own area so this is an idea battle you know you ve got a lot of questions and i want to answer them all but let me say not every one of these things can be distilled simply into politics you know who s for this and who s for that and if this person is for this somebody else has got to be for that a lot of these things honestly involved real debates over ideas over who s right and wrong about the world toward which we re moving and the answers are not self evident and one of the reasons that i wanted to run for president is i wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way so i just have a difference of opinion i believe that the concept of nafta is sound even though as you know i thought that the details needed to be improved q mr president there was a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the russian document that purported to show that the vietnamese had held back american prisoners general vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was authentic he believes that it was incorrect do you have a personal view at this point about that issue and more broadly do you believe that in fact the vietnamese did return all the american prisoners at the time of the paris peace accord the president first let me say i saw general vessey before he went to vietnam and after he returned and i have a high regard for him and i appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this way as to whether the document had any basis in fact let me say that the government of vietnam was more forthcoming than it had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to undermine the validity of the russian documents claim i do not know whether that is right or wrong we are having it basically evaluated at this time and when we complete the evaluation we ll tell you and of course we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were pows i think that we ll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last interchange but i cannot say that i m fully satisfied that we know all that we need to know there are still some cases that we don t know the answer to but i do believe we re making some progress i was encouraged by the last trip q i d like to follow up on that before the u s normalizes relations allows trade to go forward do you have to be personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to resolve these cases the vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to us to confirm good faith the president a lot of experts say you can never resolve every case every one that we couldn t resolve all the cases for them and that there are still some cases that have not been factually resolved going back to the second world war but what i would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time and that there was a complete open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving those cases and we re not there yet again i have to be guided a little bit by people who know a lot about this and i confess to being much more heavily influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other things which seem so compelling in this moment i just am very influenced by how the families feel q your economic stimulus package are you doing some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans your legislative plans for the coming year including the crime bill the health care initiative and other things are there any plans to do that and also did you underestimate the power of senator bob dole the president no what i underestimated was the extent to which what i thought was a fairly self evident case particularly after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this congress including the republicans who were in this congress last year when we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over billion in deficit reduction when they had voted repeatedly for supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments i thought at least four of them would vote to break cloture and i underestimated that i did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that i also thought that if i made a good faith effort to negotiate and to compromise that it would not be rebuffed instead every time i offered something they reduced the offer that they had previously been talking to the majority leader about so it was a strange set of events but i think what happened was what was a significant part of our plan but not the major part of it acquired a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits so that a lot of republicans were saying to me privately mr president i d like to be for this but i can t now and we re all strung out and we re divided and i think we need to do a reality check as i said what i want to know let me go back to what i said what i want to know from our folks and from our friends in the senate on and republicans or democrats is what could i have done differently to make it come out differently because the real losers here were not the president and the administration the real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who won t have jobs now we could have put another kids to work this summer i mean we could have done a lot of good things with that money and i think that is very very sad and it became more political than it should have but the underlying rationale i don t think holds a lot of water that it was deficit spending that just won t wash q and redo the president no i mean you know for example you mentioned the crime bill i think it would be a real mistake not to pass the crime bill i mean the crime bill was almost on the point of passage last year and they were all fighting over the brady bill surely surely after what we have been through in this country just in the last three months with the kind of mindless violence we have seen we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a waiting period before they buy a handgun and surely we can see that we need more police officers on the street that s another thing that i really believe that once we move some of that money not all but some of it up into this jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the street who d been laid off that would be a compelling case i mean people are scared in this country and i think we need to go forward i feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill q mr president back to the tailhook report for a second that report contained very strong criticism of the navy s senior leadership in general but did not name any of the senior officers do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated in this including admiral kelso who was there one night in las vegas should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a right to know the names of the senior officers the president you should know that under the rules of law which apply to this i am in the chain of command there is now an inspector general s report and the law must take its course if i were to answer that question i might prejudice any decisions which might be later made in this case i don t really think i think all i can tell you is what i have already said i was very disturbed by the specific allegations in the inspector general s report and i want appropriate action to be taken until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and appropriate action is taken i have been advised that because i am the commander in chief i have to be very careful about what i say so as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or con so i can t say any more except to say that i want this thing handled in an appropriate and thorough way q mr president could i ask you for a clarification on bosnia you said that you were not considering introduction of american forces does that include any air forces as well as ground forces sir the president i said ground forces q you said ground forces could i ask you sir if you fear that using u s air strikes might draw the united states into a ground war there the president i just don t want to discuss our evaluation of the options anymore i ve told you that there s never been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground forces into an ongoing conflict there q with hundreds of thousands of gays in washington this weekend for the march did you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities the president no q why not the president because i and basically i wouldn t participate in other marches i think once you become president on balance except under unusual circumstances that is not what should be done but more importantly i m going to the american society of newspaper editors a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make to try to focus anew on what i think are the fundamental issues at stake for our country right now and i expect that i will say something about the fact that a lot of americans have come here asking for a climate that is free of discrimination asking basically to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be treated like other american citizens if they do that and just that and that s always been my position not only for the gays who will be here but for others as well thank you very much end

about the way the president handled the notifications yesterday mr stephanopoulos sure q did you for instance talk to the justice department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in waco and whether it should be the attorney general or the president mr stephanopoulos why don t we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on the contact between the justice department and the white house as you know and as we ve said the president spoke with the attorney general on sunday sunday afternoon they had a good discussion about minutes the attorney general informed the president of what she wanted to do he raised no objections obviously she had the implicit authority from the president to go forward he raised no objections she went forward they had a discussion of a general nature about the incident again yesterday morning around a m the president spoke with the attorney general again they had a brief discussion over what was happening in waco as you know this was before the fire broke out at the compound and i think that was why there was some just some confusion i think that she was confusing in her minds before and after the fire not the actual day when they spoke then there was a number of contacts at a number of different levels in the white house yesterday afternoon between the justice department and the white house they were informing us of their decisions what they would like to do there was an fbi briefing in waco the attorney general had her press conference the president then issued a statement after that frankly yesterday afternoon you know there was a fair amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in waco and i think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the president say anything until we had a much better sense of what was actually happening on the ground once we were fairly clear on what was happening on the ground in waco the president issued a statement he spoke with the attorney general again yesterday evening q at what hour was that mr stephanopoulos it was quite late i believe it was after he returned from the holocaust museum he took a tour of the holocaust museum last night q and he went out to dinner mr stephanopoulos i believe briefly yes he went to dinner and then he spoke with the attorney general last night i don t know the exact time i think it was relatively late and he just said i think as dee dee has reported that he just wanted to tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well that she did a good job in a tough situation and that she should try and get some sleep he then again spoke with her this morning about the follow up in waco and about what they re going to do this afternoon as you know the president will have an announcement to make at q did he ever talk with webb hubbell yesterday last night or this morning mr stephanopoulos not to my knowledge no q was webb hubbell the point man for the white house mr stephanopoulos webb hubbell is the general white house liaison and several people talked to webb the attorney general was running the operation q did he tell her that she should sleep well that she had done a good job or he just tell her that she should get some sleep mr stephanopoulos i think sleep well done a good job i don t know the exact words i think that sounds right q i mean sleep well has implications as to conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not mr stephanopoulos well i mean i think everybody feels badly when you have a situation when q i understand that but whether the issue of blame is brought up in that phraseology mr stephanopoulos i think that s the spirit no it has nothing to do with that the spirit with which it was offered was that the entire administration and certainly the attorney general had to face a very difficult decision a very difficult situation yesterday and that he thought that she had handled it well as best as she could and q well does he think it was mishandled mr stephanopoulos it was just speaking of warm words to a friend q does he think the situation was mishandled mr stephanopoulos the president q in retrospect mr stephanopoulos the president stands by the decisions of the law enforcement agencies the decisions of the attorney general he accepts full responsibility at the same time i think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what exactly happened do a full review and make sure we do what we can to make sure this doesn t happen this kind of thing doesn t happen again or at least we know how to handle it q how much did he know about what she was going to go ahead with i know that she made the case to him explained outlined the case for action did she say to him on sunday precisely what action mr stephanopoulos i don t think it was specific operational detail as to what was going to happen i think that they had a general discussion about the action about the advisability of action i think as she noted he asked a few general questions just trying to get a sense of how things were considered but it wasn t minute by minute detail of how the operation q well was it we are going in is it we re going to use tear gas i mean what mr stephanopoulos i believe it was that we want to go in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in the compound and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement out q george was there ever a conscious political decision made or even a discussion about distancing the president from mr stephanopoulos not at all i mean we were in close contact with the justice department the president accepts responsibility for this at the same time i mean we just wanted to be very very clear about how this happened and be as factual as we could be on how the decisions were made it is the responsibility of those on the ground to make recommendations the attorney general has operational control over this the president obviously accepts responsibility for all of this and he stands by the attorney general q george there was a report on the television today and i don t know more than that one of the members of the cult had said going into a courthouse that the fbi had started the fire and not themselves there was also a picture yesterday on the tv of a smashing into the building where the fire broke out and my question is is the white house absolutely certain that this fire was mr stephanopoulos all the evidence we have is that this fire was started by david koresh and those inside the compound every bit of evidence we have q did the president ask the attorney general why do this now why this particular date and did he ask about possible consequences of either death or injury mr stephanopoulos i don t know the specific questions he had general questions about how the decision was going about being made q those are general questions and did he ask generally why now mr stephanopoulos i think he asked have you considered all of the consequences have you considered the recommendations i don t know if he asked the question why now i don t know if he asked that specific question q did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff that s come out since then about the information provided by the listening device about koresh getting increasingly more violent mr stephanopoulos again i m not certain how much specific detail they got into i know that she generally said that this is the recommendation she s prepared to make i mean the decision she s prepared to make it s based on the recommendations she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of those involved again i do not know how precisely detailed it was beyond that q what is the president s understanding why yesterday one of the people who went into the compound a couple weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this action why yesterday mr stephanopoulos this is the first i ve heard i think what we can go to is what the fbi and the attorney general has said there were indications that those inside the compound were at some danger it was clear that the negotiations had broken down and it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that the situation was not going to get any better at all there was also some concern over the vulnerability of the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that these teams normally have to work and as the attorney general has said there was some concern over the fact that they did not have replacements in place who could stand in for them and there was a concern over the safety all of these factors came into play they also considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts on david koresh and those in the compound i would just go back to what the attorney general has said you have to make the best judgment you can given the information you have at the time they did obviously we all regret the loss of life it s a terribly unfortunate situation we all wish it could have turned out differently but that doesn t take away from the judgments that were made at the time q george when did the president know that they were going to use tear gas was it before the assault on the compound mr stephanopoulos i just don t know i don t believe he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go i just don t know q along that point george can you say whether the plan was presented to the president by the attorney general as a way to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday mr stephanopoulos i think it was presented as a way to increase the pressure on those in the compound and we all hoped as a way to move some of those out and bring it in it wasn t presented as tomorrow is d day this is it q is the president satisfied that a he had all this relevant information necessary to make a decision and b that janet reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision mr stephanopoulos oh i think he s satisfied that they were acting on the best advice and the best information they had and he s not second guessing it in any way whatsoever q george was there a hour gap between conversations between the president and the attorney general in other words they spoke at a m and they didn t speak again until clinton got back from dinner at mr stephanopoulos i think that s likely yes q did he call her what time did she call was there a gap between when she called him i mean was he at dinner when she called and mr stephanopoulos no no no i think he called her last night i couldn t swear to it but i believe he called her last night he just wanted to talk to her q what was going on mr stephanopoulos not that i know of no q what do you know about the situation now everyone has perished who except eight or nine and do you know any of the other details mr stephanopoulos i don t know any more details than the fbi reported in waco q watching cnn or how was he keeping track of what is going on if he wasn t talking to his attorney general how was he keeping track of what was going on here i mean with all due respect to cnn is that how he was doing it mr stephanopoulos no there was also as i said several people in the white house were in constant contact with their counterparts at justice to have the full and complete information q who were those contacts i mean was it mack mclarty webb hubbell how was the president being kept informed that s not a mr stephanopoulos i believe mack was in contact with webb i spoke with several people at the justice department i believe bruce lindsey spoke with people at the justice department either bernie or vince was also in contact at different times during the day with people at the justice department we were fully briefed and fully informed q we were told this morning that the president may have spoken a chance that he may have spoken with webb do you know if that s true or not mr stephanopoulos i think there s a chance he may have i don t believe he did but i think there s certainly a chance that he may have at some point i don t believe he did i think that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with the justice department was the a m phone call with the attorney general but the white house was fully informed on a minute to minute basis of what was happening in waco and what was happening at the justice department q george who decided that the briefing would be done by the attorney general mr stephanopoulos the attorney general q did you or did the white house communications staff were you ever involved with that decision mr stephanopoulos no we were told about it q did you ask her to go on nightline and macneil lehrer and all that stuff was that part of mr stephanopoulos no q there was no advice from the white house at all about her she was on all night all day laughter mr stephanopoulos yes and she did a very good job q why did you decide to have the president s reaction to the situation be only a written statement which is traditionally the white house s way of distancing the president from the issue not having him appear as personally saying anything mr stephanopoulos well that wasn t the intent at all as i said we had to we wanted to wait until we had all of the information at hand the president is also making a statement today the president made a statement yesterday morning the president has been fully involved q after this turned into less than a successful operation the only statement from the president was what was on paper after the attorney general had already given what amounted to the major facts in this mr stephanopoulos well it was the first statement from the president not the only statement from the president number one q after the mr stephanopoulos number two well the first number two the attorney general q he gave a statement early in the morning when the thing was starting to move mr stephanopoulos right and he gave one yesterday and he s giving one today now the second point q it just happens this was a written statement with no sort of communications policy or thought process involved it was the president wants to put out a written statement mr stephanopoulos knowing what we knew at the time we thought it was appropriate for the president and he thought it was appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and expressing his support for the attorney general s q why was it not appropriate for him to personally do something mr stephanopoulos well he did personally do so that is his statement it s a statement under his name q george yesterday during the briefing you didn t say the president took full responsibility for what happened mr stephanopoulos i certainly did q no what you said was mr stephanopoulos that s just not right susan q well i think you can go back to the transcript i mean unless i miss something mr stephanopoulos i d love to q janet reno said that she took full responsibility and you said that she made the decision that the fbi mr stephanopoulos and the president takes responsibility absolutely q took responsibility all right mr stephanopoulos check the transcript q considering how little was known about what was going on inside the compound and even now how little is known why is washington calling this a mass suicide mr stephanopoulos well i think that knowing what we know now and given all of the actions of david koresh before and during it is painfully clear that those there were under his control q it s stretching it a little bit where the kids are concerned though isn t it george mr stephanopoulos i think that that is an entirely different matter i mean i think that david koresh must bear responsibility for the deaths of those children absolutely but he clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident and that s what he did q you re still operating completely on assumption right i mean you have no evidence or you know of no evidence that this was mass suicide mr stephanopoulos we have evidence that those inside the compound set fire to the compound which led to the deaths of those inside q i didn t quite hear it this might be ann s question i didn t quite hear it but at what time did clinton himself put out a statement on this i know dee dee said some stuff on this at p m but the president put out mr stephanopoulos at p m p m q right after the evening news went on the air mr stephanopoulos no right when we had all the information we were working on it q dee dee confirmed this morning that the investigation the president is going to announce is going to be an administration run investigation why not have someone from the outside to make sure that it s not colored by those who would have a political stake particularly those at the atf whose actions have already been mr stephanopoulos i think that clearly the atf and the justice department will bear responsibility for the investigation that s not to rule out as is often in investigations like this having some sort of independent involvement as well but it will be run by the treasury and justice q are you confident that you will not have any problem getting mr stephanopoulos absolutely q george did the president reach out to anybody else to get advice after the meeting with janet reno and who else in the white house sat in on that meeting anyone else from justice mr stephanopoulos i don t believe anybody else was there at the time it was a phone call on monday it wasn t a meeting q sunday mr stephanopoulos sunday it was a phone call it wasn t a meeting i believe he might have been there with bruce but beyond that i think he just talked to the attorney general q george you said that in that phone call she said that we want to go in and take action as you said that will force him out what did he think she was talking about if he didn t know about tear gas what exactly was his idea of what he was approving mr stephanopoulos i think he was approving an action to increase the pressure on q q it didn t matter how she did that mr stephanopoulos no no i mean q what information did he have in terms of how this would proceed presumably he would have wanted to know not minute by minute but in a general sense mr stephanopoulos i think he knew that this was the recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the law enforcement agencies i just don t know q what is this when you say that this was the recommendation mr stephanopoulos the action to increase pressure i don t know exactly what he was told whether he was going to be told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a hole in the window or whether he was just told generally that they were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure i just don t know q it s hard to imagine him not asking though q that janet reno presented him with as her best advice about what they should go forward with he would have agreed mr stephanopoulos he was he did ask some general questions about the advice and recommendation he gave at the same time and i would repeat that this was based on the unanimous recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved q george it would seem that this question about just exactly in what detail the president was informed about the nature of the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere can you take that question and mr stephanopoulos absolutely yes q get the answer and come back to us with all of it mr stephanopoulos yes q can you tell us that there was never a meeting a strategy session where you and others decided we will put out a written statement from the president and we will have janet reno be on all of these television broadcasts mr stephanopoulos never never q and you never called the justice department and said to anyone or janet reno you re the one who needs to be out front explaining this mr stephanopoulos not once q it just happened that way that she was the spokesman that no one ever saw bill sessions until mr stephanopoulos she made a decision as attorney general that it was important for her as the operational officer in charge as the person who made the decision to go out and take the questions on this tragic incident q she had no guidance from the white house at all mr stephanopoulos we certainly didn t object q but did you laughter no i m sure you didn t object but did you suggest it was this a plan mr stephanopoulos no absolutely not q a strategy mr stephanopoulos no q did she clear it mr stephanopoulos no q did she notify you mr stephanopoulos we certainly knew about it q what happened to this great detailed process you have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and every under every rock and every place in government that something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion between you and the public information people at least at the justice department mr stephanopoulos the attorney general made the decision and the attorney general wanted to go forward it seemed like a good decision it was a good decision she did a good job q let me ask it this way george if in hindsight how you would handle it mr stephanopoulos i think it was handled very well q you wouldn t change a thing if mr stephanopoulos change what q the way the white house handled any part of it from start to finish mr stephanopoulos well i think that s an awful broad question and we re certainly going to have a review one of the reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that something like this see what we can learn from an incident like this and see what we can learn about how to handle them if you re talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences no there wouldn t make any change at all q two questions first of all on her going on tv no white house people or outside media consultants came up with this idea it s just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the campaign mr stephanopoulos how so q i m thinking of like watching clinton on nightline after the draft story watching clinton on mr stephanopoulos there s absolutely no comparison yesterday there was a law enforcement incident the incident ended in tragic deaths of many many people the attorney general was involved in that decision the attorney general made the decision to do that she felt it was her responsibility in the interest of public information to go out and take the questions of the press in order to make sure that all of the questions were answered and she did a fantastic job q the second question is did as someone who knows clinton as well as you do can you understand why it s sort of hard to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about what she intended to do in other words she came and she said i m going to put pressure on them it s hard not to see clinton who s fairly intelligent and inquisitive asking how q what kind mr stephanopoulos both the attorney general said that he did ask questions he did ask general questions i don t have a minute by minute account of the conversation q how long a conversation mr stephanopoulos i think it was about minutes q telephone conversation mr stephanopoulos yes q george was the federal cost of this standoff ever a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure mr stephanopoulos i don t believe so no q george you keep saying that the president takes full responsibility but then you refer to it as her decision does the president not accept the fact that as commander in chief it is ultimately his decision mr stephanopoulos i don t know what this has to do with commander in chief this was a law enforcement action not a military action and he clearly takes responsibility for the decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his government i mean i think there s just no ambiguity about that q but is he accepting it as his decision as well as hers or is he saying it s her decision there s a difference mr stephanopoulos as a matter of fact it was her decision he did not object to that decision he clearly takes full responsibility q george this briefing has gone on just a little over minutes and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged what exactly did they spend minutes talking about if it was just very general that s a long period of time in a phone conversation mr stephanopoulos it is an awful long phone conversation it was a very important phone conversation i think brit has asked that we take the question and i ve said that i would q one of the things reno said last night is that the buck stops here i think that was her direct quotation does the president agree with that in this case mr stephanopoulos the president says he accepts full responsibility i think what the attorney general was saying is that she made a decision that she s going to accept all the responsibility that comes to her and she s not shrinking from that at all but neither is the president q at any point in the conversation last night between the president and the attorney general or this morning did she ever offer her a resignation mr stephanopoulos not to my knowledge q even before the fire was out yesterday there were some republicans on capitol hill calling for an investigation is the white house at all concerned about the timing of those requests trying to make political hay out of this situation mr stephanopoulos no and i don t want to cast any questions about the motives of those who are requesting investigation we want an investigation and we ll have a full and complete investigation q in what forum will you answer brit s question will you put out a written statement will you the wires how will you answer the question that you ve taken mr stephanopoulos i m just not sure q george can you remind us what the president was doing all yesterday afternoon where he was and what meetings he was involved in mr stephanopoulos i ll have to try and remember he had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during the afternoon he was certainly monitoring the situation in waco and getting periodic reports on that as well he did see some on cnn as well i believe he saw a fair amount of the fbi press briefing as well q and those reports would have come to him from mack mclarty would they do you think mr stephanopoulos mack talked to him bruce talked to him i talked to him q george to follow helen s question in their conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last night in response to the question about whether she would resign did he say i don t know why you felt the need to say that i m here to reassure you that you don t have to do this did that come up at all mr stephanopoulos i don t know if it even came up that specifically i know that the bulk of the conversation was discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation q the didn t talk at all about her kind of remarkable comment last night about mr stephanopoulos well i believe she was asked a question q and her response was if the president wants me to i will mr stephanopoulos which would be i think the standard response that most cabinet members would give i mean it s a conditional statement q have a need to talk about whether personally about whether the president wanted her mr stephanopoulos i don t know if they talked about it i mean what i learned about the conversation was that it was largely about the investigation itself and this just didn t come up i did not ask the question if they talked about q will you take that with the brit package mr stephanopoulos certainly laughter q george for the record does the president want her to resign i know dee dee answered this morning mr stephanopoulos absolutely not he supports janet reno she s a good attorney general she s done a good job she handled a difficult situation extremely well q george does the president feel that he and janet reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law enforcement experts on the ground mr stephanopoulos no and the president is not second guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way that is not to say that he doesn t regret the loss of life everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation but the best judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best information we had q george the minute conversation was the one on sunday is that correct mr stephanopoulos yes q how long was the one at a m yesterday morning mr stephanopoulos i don t know i ll take that question too q were these outside experts that they were consulting with or experts within the atf and the fbi mr stephanopoulos you d have to ask them i m just not sure i know that there were several experts q and also why weren t there replacements for these people is the unit that small mr stephanopoulos again i think it is a very small highly specialized unit but i think it s one of the kinds of things that the investigation will examine q george isn t there a factor here involving the fbi director normally a president when he wants to get information doesn t only asks the attorney general i know the chain of command but presidents talk to their fbi directors in this case throughout this entire siege he has not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to bill sessions who is from waco and get expertise from him on what to do and what not to do mr stephanopoulos i think he talked to the fbi director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke out in waco at the same time the attorney general bears the ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the attorney general q don t you think the ambiguous situation that director sessions is in has some impact on the way the president is briefed and on the way that all of this evolved mr stephanopoulos not at all i mean it s perfectly appropriate that he be briefed by the attorney general and that the attorney general has supervisory authority over the fbi director and that s following the chain of command the press thank you end p

known as low achieving or at risk to reach for excellence and to attain it this is what our students need and what our country needs today we know that a good future with high wages and rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a lifetime the basics aren t enough anymore all our kids need competence in math and science and advanced problem solving that s why

relations with russia and the other new independent states the president today has ordered an executive review of laws and regulations so that where appropriate and consistent with u s security and other national interests such provisions can be revised or removed he has asked ambassador at large strobe talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis the president has indicated that he will welcome congressional efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible this review will weigh all considerations that pertain to revision of such provisions and the initiation of the review may help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such provisions in the past for example because the russians are eager to have their status changed under the jackson vanik

debate on this issue i m also not going to prolong the debate on this i wanted to respond to a couple of the points you make but this will be my last posting on this no don t stop right to equal opportunity lets call it reo involves coercion in all cases by definition one question is it your position that there is no reo or just that this is a lesser right to foa good question it just depends how s that for an answer seriously i believe that it depends on wether or not you are talking about a governmental employer or not in this case i believe that there should be absolutely no discrimination direct or indirect period i feel this way not because it would offend my moral sensibilities which it of course would but because the government is a coercive entity which we cannot escape it boggles my mind that in my lifetime there were whites only drinking fountains in some parks but no fountains for others yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains certainly were not applied to whites only in essence we cannot escape the coercive state even randy weavers have to pay property tax on the other hand private employers are not a monopoly and their businesses should be run by them and not by the government unless they elect to turn their affairs over to that government why says who why can mom pop have foa but ibm be forced and force is the correct word here to have reo in the case of the mom pop store their foa is directly affected they as individuals will have to associate with whomever they hire in the case of ibm i ask again whose foa are we protecting i do not accept that ibm as a corporate entity has a right to foa but if the mom pop store is affected by who they hire isn t ibm there is a slippery slope here in santa cruz where a number of loony anti discrimination laws exist a guy sued a restaurant for not hiring him because he had every imaginable kitchen utensil dangling from his earlobe and his tatoos were very distracting suddenly by arm waving by magic a landlord does not have foa and on what basis does the foa of the landlord disappear it seems that vague terms like no contact with tenants suffice on the basis that the landlord has no contact with his her tenants if the landlord doesn t associate with his tenants then how can he complain that his foa is being violated i have a lot of interaction all positive with my tenants so i guess that that isn t an issue but say i were to buy a unit in another town and have it managed by a third party let s say that i have a real aversion to christians because of the stuff that they buy into hook line and sinker and because of the lunatic schmucks that they try to get elected i don t want any of those fish symbols hanging in the window of a house that i own should the government intervene if i was elie weizel and the only rental applicant was tom metzger should i be forced to rent this distant unit to him the companies on the fortune for example are all privately owned they can give you a list of all of their owners they have no anonymous unknown to them owners publicly owned in the sense that their stock is publicly traded and that the shares of stock are owned by a generic and ever changing public yes and the neat thing about this is that unlike the mom pop store you and i can buy shares in ibm and have influence over their decision making policies if we don t

north pole on june and two of the soviet union s mighty proton rockets lifted off from the tyuratam space center in the kazakhstan republic aboard those boosters were a new breed of venera probe for the planet venus designated venera and the probes were meant not for landing yet more spherical craft on the venerean surface but to radar map the planet in detail from orbit to accomplish this task the basic venera design was modified in numerous areas the central bus core was made one meter inches longer to carry the two tons of propellant required for braking into orbit double the fuel carried by the venera and orbiters eight years earlier extra solar panels were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging the dish shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger to properly transmit this information to earth atop the buses where landers were usually placed were installed the by meter by foot kilogram pound polyus v side looking radar antennae the radar system possibly a terrain imaging version of the nuclear powered satellites used by the soviets for earth ocean surveillance would be able to map venus surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers to miles the soviet probes imaging parameters were a vast improvement over the united states pioneer venus orbiter which could reveal objects no smaller than kilometers miles in diameter and while the veneras resolution was comparable to that of similar observations made by the meter foot arecibo radio telescope on the island of puerto rico the orbiters would be examining the northern pole of venus this region was unobtainable by either arecibo or pioneer venus and appeared to contain a number of potentially interesting geological features worthy of investigation on october after an interplanetary journey of million kilometers million miles and two mid course corrections venera fired its braking rockets over venus to place itself in a polar orbit by kilometers by miles around the planet completing one revolution every twenty four hours venera followed suit four days later the twin probes thus became venus first polar circling spacecraft radar operations began on october for venera and october for venera for up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north pole the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface kilometers ninety miles wide and nine thousand kilometers miles long the craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back to two large soviet antennae on earth each strip of information took eight hours to process by computer by the end of their main missions in july of the veneras had mapped million square kilometers million square miles thirty percent of the entire planet venera and revealed that venus has a surface geology more complex than shown by pioneer venus in the late s numerous hills mountains ridges valleys and plains spread across the landscape many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the last one billion years in planetary terms this makes the venerean surface rather young hundreds of craters were detected as well the largest of which had to have been created by meteorites planetoids would be a better term here at least fourteen kilometers miles across due to venus very dense atmosphere there were some disagreements between u s and soviet scientists on the origins of certain surface features for example the probes owners declared that the kilometer mile wide crater at the summit of meter foot high maxwell montes the tallest mountain on the planet was the result of a meteorite impact american scientists on the other hand felt the crater was proof that maxwell was a huge volcano sitting on the northern continent of ishtar terra in any event the u s decided to wait on making verdicts about venus until the arrival of their own radar probe scheduled for later in the decade originally named the venus orbiting imaging radar voir its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig nated the venus radar mapper vrm eventually the machine would be called magellan after the portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan circa this vehicle would map the entire planet in even finer detail than the veneras for the time however the soviet probes maintained that distinction radar imaging was not the only ability of the veneras bolted next to the polyus v radar antenna were the omega altimeter and the fourier infrared spectrometer the latter for measuring the world s temperatures the majority of the areas covered registered about five hundred degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit but a few locations were two hundred degrees hotter possibly indicating current volcanic activity the probes also found that the clouds over the poles were five to eight kilometers three to miles lower than at the equator in contrast the polar air above sixty kilometers thirty six miles altitude was five to twenty degrees warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights when the main mapping mission ended in july of there were plans for at least one of the veneras to radar image the surface at more southernly latitudes unfortunately this idea did not come to pass as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude control gas to perform the operation venera and ceased transmission in march of leaving the soviet institute of radiotechnology and electronics with six hundred kilometers miles of radar data tape to sort into an atlas of twenty seven maps of the northern hemisphere of venus venus by balloon for years the thick atmosphere of venus had been a tempting target to scientists who wished to explore the planet s mantle of air with balloon borne instruments professor jacques blamont of the french space agency centre national d etudes spatiales cnes had proposed such an idea as far back as only to have a joint french soviet balloon mission canceled in nevertheless late in the year such dreams would eventually come true when two proton rockets were sent skyward on december and the soviet union provided western observers with the first clear full views of the booster which had been launching every soviet venus probe since this was but one of many firsts for the complex mission the unmanned probes launched into space that december were named vega and a contraction of the words venera and gallei gallei being the russian word for halley not only did the spacecraft have more than one mission to perform they also had more than one celestial objective to explore namely the comet halley this famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to the inner regions of the solar

to exploring one of the few such bodies which actually come close to earth most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar system some like halley are perturbed by various forces and fall in towards the sun where they circle for millennia spewing out ice and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar encounter the soviet union along with the european space agency esa and japan s institute of space and astronautical science isas did not wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a close examination of halley the esa would be using the cylindrical giotto probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the comet while japan s first deep space craft sakigake pioneer and suisei comet would view halley from a much safer distance scientists in the united states also desired to study the comet from the vantage of a space probe at one time envisioning a vessel powered by solar sails or ion engines however government budget cuts to nasa canceled the american efforts the u s would have to make do primarily with earth based observations and the sharing of data from other nations though an instrument named the dust counter and mass analyzer ducma designed by chicago university professor john simpson was added on the soviet mission in may of the soviets answer to halley were the vegas instead of building an entirely new craft for the mission the soviets decided to modify their venera bus design to encounter the comet while performing an advanced venus mission along the way as vega and reached venus the buses would drop off one lander balloon each and use the mass of the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet halley much as the u s probe mariner used venus to flyby mercury eleven years earlier the soviet craft would then head on to halley helping to pinpoint the location of the comet s erupting nucleus for the giotto probe to dive in only kilometers miles away in march of as planned the two vegas arrived at venus in june of vega released its payload first on the ninth day of the month the lander making a two day descent towards the planet the craft touched the upper atmosphere on the morning of june sixty one kilometers miles above the venerean surface a small container was released by the lander which produced a parachute at kilometers miles altitude thus the first balloon probe ever to explore venus had successfully arrived one kilometer after the opening of the parachute helium gas was pumped into the teflon coated plastic balloon inflating it to a diameter of meters feet dangling on a tether thirteen meters feet below was the instrument package properly known as an aerostat the top part of the kilogram pound aerostat consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment point to the balloon beneath it was the transmitter electronics and instruments connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for measuring cloud particles the aerostat was painted with a special white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which permeated the planet s atmosphere the vega balloon was dropped into the night side of venus just north of the equator scientists were concerned that the gas bag would burst in the heat of daylight so they placed it in the darkened hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data this action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as well effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions the author wonders though if they could have used floodlights similar to the ones attached to venera and in when soviet scientists had thought the planet s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight due to the permanently thick cloud cover the first balloon transmitted for hours right into the day hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed covering kilometers miles the threat of bursting in the day heat did not materialize the vega balloon was stationed at a kilometer mile altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers thirty miles for this was considered the most active of the three main cloud layers reported by pioneer venus in indeed the balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to kilometers miles per hour strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and down two to three hundred meters to feet through most of the journey the layer s air temperature averaged forty degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit and pressure was a mere earth atmosphere the nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds early in the first balloon s flight the vega lander was already headed towards the venerean surface both landers were equipped with a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on venera and in however vega would become unable to report the composition of the ground at its landing site in rusalka planitia the mermaid plain north of aphrodite terra while still ten to fifteen minutes away from landing a timer malfunction caused the drill to accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers miles above the surface there was neither any way to shut off the instrument before touchdown nor reactivate it after landing this was unfortunate not only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of venus was covered with such smooth low level lava plains and had never before been directly examined nevertheless the surface temperature and pressure was calculated at degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit and earth atmospheres respectively during the lander s minutes of ground transmissions a large amount of background infrared radiation was also recorded at the site as had been done when the drills and cameras on venera and had failed in december of the soviets focused on the data returned during the lander s plunge through the atmosphere the french soviet malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur chlorine and possibly phosphorus it is the sulfur possibly from active volcanoes which gives the venerean clouds their yellowish color the sigma gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air between an altitude of and kilometers and miles contained one milligram grain of sulfuric acid the vega data on the overall structure of the cloud decks appeared to be at odds with the information from pioneer venus the case was made even stronger by the fact that vega s results nearly matched its twin the vegas found only two main cloud layers instead of the three reported by the u s probes the layers were three to five kilometers to miles thick at altitudes of and kilometers and miles the clouds persisted like a thin fog until clearing at an altitude of kilometers miles much lower than the pv readings one possibility for the discrepan cies may have been radical structural changes in the venerean air over the last seven years when the lander and balloon finally went silent the last functioning part of the vega mission the flyby bus sailed on for a million kilometer million mile journey around the sun to become the first probe to meet comet halley on march the bus made a kilometer mile pass at the dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space the soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial bodies with one space vessel on june vega released its lander balloon payload for a two day fall towards venus like its duplicate the vega balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking it on earth for hours before battery failure on the morning side of the planet during its kilometer mile flight over venus the second balloon entered in a rather still environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission after hours mission time the air became even more turbulent for a further eight hours when the balloon passed over a five kilometer three mile mountain on the continent of aphrodite terra a powerful downdraft pulled the craft kilometers miles towards the surface temperature sensors on the vega balloon reported that the air layer it was moving through was consistently degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit cooler than the area explored by the vega balloon this was corroborated by the vega lander as it passed through the balloon s level no positive indications of lightning were made by either balloon and the second aerostat s nephelometer failed to function the vega lander touched down on the northern edge of aphrodite terra s western arm on the fifteenth of june kilometers miles southeast of vega the lander s resting place was smoother than thought indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a relatively young one covered in fresh lava the soil drill was in working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite troctolite rare on earth but present in luna s highlands this rock is rich in aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium a high degree of sulfur was also present in the soil the air around vega measured degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit and earth atmospheres essentially a typical day or night on venus far above the vega lander its carrier bus sped past venus at a distance of kilometers miles and followed its twin to comet halley making a closer flyby on march at just kilometers miles both probes helped to reveal that the comet is a very dark and irregular shaped mass about fourteen kilometers miles across rotating once every hours give or take three hours since both vega craft were still functioning after their halley encounters soviet scientists considered an option to send the probes to other celestial objects one prime target was the near earth planetoid adonis which vega could pass at a distance of six million kilometers million miles sadly the soviets had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach adonis as planned vega and were quietly shut down in early future plans diverted the impressive vega mission had given some scientists numerous ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second world from the sun one example was the vesta mission planned for the early s this soviet french collaboration called for the launch of multiple probes on a single proton rocket in either or the craft would first swing by venus and drop off several landers and balloon probes the aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet s corrosive atmosphere for up to one month a large improvement over the vega balloons two days the mission would then head out to investigate several planetoids and comets including a possible landing on vesta thus the mission name the most reflective main belt planetoid as seen from earth unfortunately for venus exploration plans began to change in the soviet union in the soviets decided to reroute the vesta mission to the red planet mars instead of venus keeping the comet and planetoid aspects intact by this time in the soviet space program interest was focusing on mars already under construction was an entirely new probe design called phobos two members of this class were planned to leave earth in and orbit mars the next year phobos and would then place the first instruments on mars largest moon phobos all this was a prelude to even more advanced mars expeditions including balloon probes rovers soil sample return craft and eventually human explorers in the early twenty first century the environment of venus was just too hostile for any serious consideration of human colonization in the near future but things began to look bleak for soviet venus and mars exploration both phobos probes failed to complete their missions one losing contact on the way to the red planet in and the other going silent in mars orbit just one week before the planned moon landing in march of in a plan was devised for a venus orbiter to drop eight to ten penetrators around the planet in several years later the mission launch date was moved to the year and has now been put on indefinite hold no other official soviet missions to venus have since been put forth a sad commentary after twenty five years of continuous robotic exploration of the planet during the late s a drastic political and economic change was taking over the soviet union president mikhail gorbachev began to open up his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with the rest of the nations particularly those in the west while the culture became less oppressive than in the past the economy was taking a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a free market these effects hit everywhere including the space program missions at all levels were cut back the soviets began making almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space faring nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to make money in early it was reported that the soviets were offering for sale several fully equipped veneras they had in storage for the price of million dollars each an incredibly low price for any planetary probe no nation took them up on the bargain meanwhile the united states was gearing up for new venus missions of their own magellan and galileo the u s reactivated their long dormant planetary exploration with the launch of the space shuttle atlantis on may aboard the shuttle was the magellan spacecraft a combination of spare parts from other u s probes designed to make the most detailed and complete radar mapping of venus in history when magellan reached the second world in august of it would be able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of meters feet surpassing the abilities of venera and in the interim another american probe was launched from a space shuttle which would make a quick flyby of venus on its way to orbit the giant planet jupiter in on october the shuttle atlantis released its second unmanned planetary probe into space named galileo after the famous italian astronomer who discovered the probe s primary target s major moons in in the absence of a powerful enough booster to send galileo on a direct flight to the jovian planet the probe was sent around venus and earth several times to build up enough speed to reach jupiter as a result venus became galileo s first planetary goal in february of the probe radioed back images of the planet s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in that violent atmosphere on the drawing boards with the incredible success of magellan in the last few years new plans have been laid out for further journeys to venus scien tists in the u s have talked to space scientists in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent states since january of a cooperative effort to launch new venera lander missions within in the next decade japan india and the esa have also considered their own venus missions in the next few decades in february of nasa came up with several new venus projects as part of their discovery program for launching inexpensive probes throughout the solar system for venus two missions were selected for further study a venus multiprobe mission involving the landing of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds air temperature and pressure and the venus composition probe designed to study venus atmosphere while descending through the thick air with the aid of a parachute much as the soviets had done since final project decisions will be made in humans on venus will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of venus at present the lead melting temperatures and crushing air pressure would be threatening to any earth life not protected in something even tougher than a venera lander plans have been looked into changing the environment of venus itself into something more like earth s however it should be noted that any such undertaking will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere a major reduction in surface heat and the ability to speed up the planet s rotation rate to something a bit faster than once every earth days such a project may take centuries if not millennia in the meantime efforts should be made to better understand venus as its exists today we still have yet to fully know how a world so seemingly similar to earth in many important ways became instead such a deadly place will earth ever suffer this fate perhaps venus holds the answers such answers may best be found through international cooperation including the nation

the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky with three detectors one gets intersecting annuli giving two possible locations if one of these

desire to see a place that man hasn t fouled in some way i think my point about a desire for beauty is valid even if it can t ever be perfectly achieved i agree that the desire for beauty is valid but i think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not you mention the age old desire to somehow get up there but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision you mention the beauty of a very dark sky not impeded by the effects of humans but ignore the beauty of the as dark as can be sky that is only visible from space a vision that we or at least our descendents may one day be able to see in part because of efforts that others call ugly one day i hope humans will be able to look out not upon half the heavens with only nature creted lights but upon all of the heavens with no lights if advertising in space can help us reach that goal it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it than the pristine sky of yesteryear or yester century which is totally unreachable one of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form in the effort of striving to reach a goal i don t think there s any reason to believe that modernity has changed that just because

not seen here yet redesign activities update following is the weekly status on redesign based on information provided by nasa headquarters the station redesign team srt provided a detailed status report to the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april the day long meeting was held in anser facilities in crystal city va topics covered by the srt included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station science technology and engineering research the assessment process and the design approach discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held the design teams then presented the three options under study option a modular buildup pete priest presented the a option priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution power station human tended and permanent presence the team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels the a option uses current or simplified freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so called bus spacecraft the orbiter and spacelab the power station capability could be achieved in flights with freedom photo voltaic modules providing kw of power day shuttle spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase human tended capability would be provided by the addition of the u s common module module which adds subsystems and payload racks and docking ports for esa and japanese laboratories day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase different operation utilization modes are being studied for this phase option b freedom derived mike griffin presented the status of option b activities griffin detailed the evolution of the freedom derived option from initial research capability to human tended capability to permanent human presence capability to two fault tolerance and finally permanent human capability griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program with minor changes to the communications and tracking system crew health care system and eclss and a major change to the data management system initial research capability would be achieved with flights to degree inclination flights to degrees and consist of an extended duration orbiter spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with photo voltaic arrays providing kw of power human tended capability would be achieved in flights and add truss segments and the u s lab permanent human presence capability would be achieved in flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return two fault tolerance achieved in flights would build out the other section of truss with another set of pv modules thermal control and propulsion systems the freedom derived configuration could achieve an international complete state with flights three more flights to bring up the habitat module a third pv array and two assured crew return vehicles acrv would complete the permanent human capability with international stage griffin told the redesign advisory committee that eliminating hardware would not by itself meet budget guidelines for the freedom derived option major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management contractor non hardware early utilization and operations costs he said option c singe launch core station chet vaughn presented option c the single launch core station concept a shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used to launch the station into orbit shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after et separation the module feet in diameter and feet long would provide cubic feet of pressured volume separated into decks connected by a centralized passageway seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules and other elements this can would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately kw of power flying in a solar interial attitude in his closing comments to the redesign advisory committee bryan o connor said a design freeze would be established for the options on

they will be available to the srt through may management and operations review continues work continued in the srt subgroups the management group under dr walt brooks is working to develop a family of

teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations utilization maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations what s in the

and so i got there early and figured that if i didn t get to the mike maybe they would read mine off of a card and so i wrote it down and handed it in after the meeting started mr shrontz said that he would only answer written questions in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs naturally i was crushed so when question and answer time came i was suprised to find my question being read and answered admittedly near the end of the ones that he took presumably getting there early and getting the question in early made all the difference so on to the substance the question was is boeing looking at anything beyond the high speed civil transport such as a commercial space launch system and if not how will boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by mcdonnell douglass well he read it without a hitch and without editing with impressed me then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question last part first this is to the best of my recollection what he said as far as single stage to orbit technology we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach and we are talking to some of our customers about that as far as commercialization that is a long ways off the high speed civil transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point so this tells me that boeing still considers space to be a non commercial arena and for the most part this is true however it also tells me that they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own now i do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing actually this is a mis nomer as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy

contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries this book is volume iii of a revised and enlarged edition of the structure of the physical universe volume i is nothing but motion and volume ii is the basic properties of matter most books and journal articles on the subject of astrophysics are bristling with integrals partial differentials and other fancy mathematics in this book by contrast mathematics is conspicuous by its absence except for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text larson emphasizes concepts and declares that mathematical agreement with a theory does not guarantee its conceptual validity dewey b larson was a retired engineer with a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed the theory described in his books while trying to find a way to mathematically calculate the properties of chemical compounds based only on the elements they contain the universe of motion describes the astrophysical portions of larson s consistent integrated comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe a kind of grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists and astro physicists claim to be looking for it is built on two postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean from these two postulates larson was able to build a complete theoretical universe from photons and subatomic particles to the giant elliptical galaxies by combining the concept of inward and outward scalar motions with translational vibrational rotational and rotational vibrational motions at each step in the development he was able to match parts of his theoretical universe with corresponding parts in the real physical universe including even things not yet discovered for example in his book he first predicted the existence of exploding galaxies several years before astronomers started finding them they are a necessary consequence of his comprehensive theory and when quasars were discovered he had a related explanation ready for those also as a result of his theory which he called the reciprocal system larson totally rejected many of the sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists including black holes neutron stars degenerate matter quantum wave mechanics as applied to atomic structure nuclear physics general relativity relativistic mass increases relativistic doppler shifts nuclear fusion in stars and the big bang all of which he considered to be nothing more than mathematical fantasies he was very critical of the ad hoc assumptions uncertainty principles solutions in principle no other way declarations etc used to maintain them the universe of motion is divided into chapters it begins with a description of how galaxies are built from the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in from the anti matter half of the physical universe galaxy formation from the mythical big bang is a big mystery to orthodox astronomers he then goes on to describe life cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and solar systems result from type i supernova explosions of single stars several chapters are devoted to quasars which according to larson are densely packed clusters of stars that have been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies and are actually traveling faster than the speed of light although most of that speed is away from us in time astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against observations that contradict their theories would find larson s explanations quite valuable if considered with an open mind for example they used to believe that gamma ray bursts originated from pulsars which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from all directions uniformly and do not correspond with any visible objects except for a few cases of directional coincidence larson s explanation is that the gamma ray bursts originate from supernova explosions in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic sector because the anti matter universe exists in a reciprocal relation to our material universe with the speed of light as the boundary between them and has three dimensions of time and only one dimension of space the bursts can pop into our material universe anywhere seemingly at random larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from books journal articles and leading physicists and astronomers in this book of them are superscripted with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the end of the book for example a quote from the book astronomy the cosmic journey by william k hartmann says our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars form unfortunately we cannot larson s book contains logical consistent explanations of such mysteries that are worthy of serious consideration by all physicists astronomers and astrophysicists for more information answers to your questions etc please consult my cited sources larson s books

particular comet aphelia which are not well known are not a good measure of the oort cloud distribution merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right energy except it doesn t explain why there is no apparent correlation with galaxies or galaxy structure there is no mechanism for getting all the energy out in gamma rays with any significant amount of baryons around there will be a lot of pair production which makes a plasma which thermalizes the energy it has trouble generating enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts ergs it happens too fast compared to the burst duration and it is hard to make tight binaries of neutron stars another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars but that uses pretty far out physics my point is that we don t have a good mechanism at any distance so grb s are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism so we can t rule out the oort cloud what would be the spectrum of an event which converts a comet to strange matter the spectra for primordial black holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets aren t quite right but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which modifies the spectrum the energy matches very well for both of these mechanisms according to trevor weeks if the tunguska meteorite was a mini black hole collision with the earth then there are likely to be enough mini black holes around that the rate for bh comet collisions matches the grb rate well the fact that we don t know the distribution of comets in the oort cloud isn t a reason to rule them out it makes it harder to rule them out the point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the right distribution for the

errors are limited by craft attitude and the resolving power of the optics batse is an altogether different beast effectively just coincidence counters one on each corner of the craft positional information is triangulated from the differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft attitude since none of the baste detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever they can not be used to determine parallax indeed parallax would just add a very small component to the positional error demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcseconds since the oort cloud is postulated to extend to about parsec all together now parallax arc second a parsec is the distance of an object that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a au base line if the degree accuracy reported above is true we re going to have to add a baste to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline the beauty of baste is that it both gives positional information and watches the entire sky simultaneously a realy handy combination when you have no idea

the question is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions this is a good question there are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable for example why does the earth s atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does the naive answer is photosynthesis but this is clearly incomplete photosynthesis by itself can t make the atmosphere oxygenated as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten what is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material on earth this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter mostly from oceanic sources however this burial requires continental sediments in the deep ocean the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered this suggests that a planet without large oceans or a planet without continents undergoing weathering will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere in particular an all ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere there is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth s atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time for a period at least orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric o to weathering in the absence of replenishment no convincing feedback mechanism has been identified

strong interest in vaporware spacecraft the dream machines an illustrated history of the spaceship in art science and literature by ron miller with foreword by arthur c clarke krieger publishing company melbourne florida usa orig ed pre publication isbn this text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon the idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century the need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years as soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one human beings wanted to reach them tracing the history of the many imaginative and often prescient attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology science astronomy and engineering once space travel became feasible there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board or off the ground for that matter these also are described in theis book for the same reason as the pre space age and pre flight ideas are they are all accurate reflections of their particular era s dreams abilities and knowledge virtually every spaceship concept invented since as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel is listed chronologically the chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures they also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries they reveal connections influences and evolutions hitherto unsuspected every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing this allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss to visualize differences similarities and influences this text will be of interest to students of astronautical history and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating the unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship special features includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft both real and fictional contains scores of illustrations

cloud of comets is kept on the list although there is no known mechanism for generating grbs from cometary nuclei unlikely as it may seem the possibility that grbs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved we use the available data on the distribution of grbs the batse catalogue up to march and the catalogue of cometary orbits by marsden and williams to investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the angular distributions of grbs and comets aphelia assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect at least to some extent true variations in the column density of the oort cloud we also apply the vov test to both distributions we have performed a variety of statistical tests a kolmogorov smirnov test for the distributions in galactic latitude a chi test for the spherical multiple moments and a d cross correlation analysis including testing sub samples for isolating the effect of possible observational biases these tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree but the statistical significance is not sufficient for ruling out any connection with complete confidence we performed monte carlo simulations which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds sim it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions currently it is only the combination of these tests with the large disagreement found for the vov parameter which makes the oort cloud of comets unlikely to be related to grbs\n", "label": "space"}, {"text": "re vandalizing

actually the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only or kelvin sorry henry and anyone else i misled obviously time for me to take another ism class in other news alan stern of the southwest research institute gave a talk on the pluto charon binary system yesterday he gave a brief overview of the currently accepted system parameters volume ratio of about mass ratio about or so plus lots more and then gave his thoughts on the formation of pluto charon his idea is that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system with masses distributed as a power law of some kind over time the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with jupiter and saturn but many accreted into the gas giants especially uranus and neptune a large planetesimal was captured by neptune we call it triton captured how perhaps by a collision with a smaller already existing neptunian moon perhaps by a very close passage through neptune s atmosphere mondo aerobraking he notes that the two recently discovered kuiper belt objects qb and fw plus chiron and pholus are all about the same mass and he identifies this group as one accretion down from the larger bodies of triton and pluto charon pluto charon he thinks formed when an impacting body hit proto pluto knocking some material into a ring around pluto which later accreted in charon similar to ideas about the formation of earth s moon there is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of pluto and charon are very different pluto has methane frost charon doesn t which can be used as evidence for the impact theory he believes that there may be around pluto to chiron sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside neptune s orbit beyond au or so qb and fw are the first members of this population to be found in his model note that such bodies will be very dark since if their surfaces are covered with methane frost it will have photolyzed into very dark long chain hydrocarbons by now the reason that pluto has such a high albedo around i think is that its surface warms up just enough around perihelion to sublimate and when the atmosphere freezes out again thirty years later it forms bright new frost so any bodies much farther away than au are going to be very hard to see i hope i haven t made any errors in the transcription if you see a howling mistake it s undoubtedly mine not his by the way he s one of the top guns behind the pluto fast flyby mission i think and said that the current plans are to use a titan to send the probe on just about a rectilinear trajectory to pluto we were speaking loosely at the time he d like to use a proton which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs much less his figures million for titan launches there will be two separate probes launched separately or million for proton launches he told a story about how the soviets

joe is interested curious about spaceflight but sees it as an elitist activity not one which he is ever going to participate in all of us in our own way can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world the document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details of long term space habitation i like the idea of the study but it should be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it if you want a general public document you ll need a more general publication i believe that if any long term space exploration program is to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld i e the spacecraft only through the careful analyses of engineering chemical biological and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long duration flight as one working on controlled ecological life support systems engineering the microworld isn t the problem the problem is understanding the basic chemical biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them efficiently for example the only way we know how to produce food is from plants and animals food synthesis is not very far advanced so we have to orbit a farm well that s obviously not very efficient so we use technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of using dirt this is where the engineering comes in but new technologies bring new basic questions that we don t have the answers to like in dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other but in hydroponics it turns out that you can t do that the lettuce growth is stunted when it s grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes so now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar interactions this means some basic applied scientific research and that s what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far we also need to find out how they interact together that s where we are now so i would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long duration spaceflight first you need to do the literature search there is a lot of information out there maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation this could be useful especially if we make it available on the net then we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs in essence we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies this database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet isunet and any other source unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net i think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search first then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis the data base itself could be useful for future engineers that s my response ken what do you think tim\n", "label": "space"},

the above three factors and how they relate to one another jonathan jonathan interesting questions some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever supported an atmosphere i d be interested in knowing what our geology environmental sciences friends think as for human tolerances the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude i e low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure is in my opinion to the scaling of mt everest without oxygen assistance this was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile i think a few months and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on mount everest where they began the ascent of our planet s highest peak without oxygen tanks this is quite a feat of physiological endurance because if you or i tried to go to feet and exert ourselves we would probably pass out get altitude sick and could even die from cerebral edema so this is the limit of low pressure high pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren t in front of me usually at a certain point the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic divers call this nitrogen narcosis those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at feet under water hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter as i am not a diving expert

to move among the stars they called these objects planets meaning wanderers and named them after roman deities jupiter king of the gods mars the god of war mercury messenger of the gods venus the god of love and beauty and saturn father of jupiter and god of agriculture the stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky science flourished during the european renaissance fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered and the orbits of the planets around the sun were calculated in the th century astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries but the years since have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration advancements in rocketry after world war ii enabled our machines to break the grip of earth s gravity and travel to the moon and to other planets the united states has sent automated spacecraft then human crewed expeditions to explore the moon our automated machines have orbited and landed on venus and mars explored the sun s environment observed comets and made close range surveys while flying past mercury jupiter saturn uranus and neptune these travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system through the electronic sight and other senses of our automated spacecraft color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to earth bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light and dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the th century automated spacecraft the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa s automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes while they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives the craft share much in common each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission supported by basic subsystems for electrical power trajectory and orientation control as well as for processing data and communicating with earth electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems nasa uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target to help prevent such a mishap a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft the thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars just as earth s early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space with the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference flight controllers can keep a spacecraft s scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft s communications antennas pointed toward earth the thrusters can also be used to fine tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory between and nasa spacecraft were dispatched to study the moon and the solar environment they also scanned the inner planets other than earth mercury venus and mars these three worlds and our own are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid rock composition for the early planetary reconnaissance missions nasa employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the mariners their flights helped shape the planning of later missions between and seven mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space all of the mariners used solar panels as their primary power source the first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells other mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies although the mariners ranged from the mariner venus spacecraft weighing in at kilograms pounds to the mariner mars orbiter weighing in at kilograms pounds their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program the mariner venus spacecraft for example had originally been a backup for the mariner mars flyby the mariner spacecraft sent to venus and mercury used components left over from the mariner mars orbiter program in nasa launched pioneer a jupiter spacecraft interest was shifting to four of the outer planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed four nasa spacecraft in all two pioneers and two voyagers were sent in the s to tour the outer regions of our solar system because of the distances involved these travelers took anywhere from months to years to reach their destinations barring faster spacecraft they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars because the sun s light becomes so faint in the outer solar system these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes nasa also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors mars and venus in the middle and late s twin viking landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories two advanced orbiters descendants of the mariner craft carried the viking landers from earth and then studied martian features from above two drum shaped pioneer spacecraft visited venus in the pioneer venus orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to see through the planet s dense cloud cover to study surface features the pioneer venus multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds the probes and the main body all of which contained scientific instruments radioed information about the planet s atmosphere during their descent toward the surface a new generation of automated spacecraft including magellan galileo ulysses mars observer the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf and cassini is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet the sun a discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the sun the sun dwarfs the other bodies representing approximately percent of all the mass in the solar system all of the planets moons asteroids comets dust and gas add up to only about percent this percent represents the material left over from the sun s formation one hundred and nine earths would be required to fit across the sun s disk and its interior could hold over million earths as a star the sun generates energy through the process of fusion the temperature at the sun s core is million degrees celsius million degrees fahrenheit and the pressure there is billion times earth s air pressure at sea level the sun s surface temperature of degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit seems almost chilly compared to its core temperature at the solar core hydrogen can fuse into helium producing energy the sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles both extending far beyond the planets the sun appears to have been active for billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so at the end of its life the sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up ultimately growing so large that it will swallow earth after a billion years as a red giant it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf the final end product of a star like ours it may take a trillion years to cool off completely many spacecraft have explored the sun s environment but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately two thirds of the distance from earth to the sun pioneers the pioneer venus orbiter voyagers and and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment the ulysses spacecraft launched on october is a joint solar mission of nasa and the european space agency after using jupiter s gravity to change its trajectory ulysses will fly over the sun s polar regions during and and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments we are fortunate that the sun is exactly the way it is if it were different in almost any way life would almost certainly never have developed on earth mercury obtaining the first close up views of mercury was the primary objective of the mariner spacecraft launched on november from kennedy space center in florida after a journey of nearly five months which included a flyby of venus the spacecraft passed within kilometers miles of the solar system s innermost planet on march until mariner little was known about mercury even the best telescopic views from earth showed mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail the planet is so close to the sun that it is usually lost in solar glare when the planet is visible on earth s horizon just after sunset or before dawn it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere only radar telescopes gave any hint of mercury s surface conditions prior to the voyage of mariner the photographs mariner radioed back to earth revealed an ancient heavily cratered surface closely resembling our own moon the pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet these apparently were created when mercury s interior cooled and shrank buckling the planet s crust the cliffs are as high as kilometers miles and as long as kilometers miles instruments on mariner discovered that mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere a trillionth the density of earth s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon neon and helium when the planet s orbit takes it closest to the sun surface temperatures range from degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit on mercury s sunlit side to degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit on the dark side this range in surface temperature degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit is the largest for a single body in the solar system mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time days and nights are long on mercury the combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars earth days and a rapid revolution around the sun earth days means that one mercury solar day takes earth days or two mercury years the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the sun mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of earth scientists believe mercury has a heavy iron rich core making up slightly less than half of its volume that would make mercury s core larger proportionally than the moon s core or those of any of the planets after the initial mercury encounter mariner made two additional flybys on september and march before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded each flyby took place at the same local mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated as a result we still have not seen one half of the planet s surface venus veiled by dense cloud cover venus our nearest planetary neighbor was the first planet to be explored the mariner spacecraft launched on august was the first of more than a dozen successful american and soviet missions to study the mysterious planet as spacecraft flew by or orbited venus plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on venus surface romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest on december mariner passed within kilometers miles of venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet onboard instruments measured venus for minutes mariner launched in june flew much closer to the planet passing within kilometers miles of venus on the second american flyby mariner s instruments measured the planet s magnetic field ionosphere radiation belts and temperatures on its way to mercury mariner flew by venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the venusian atmosphere in the spring and summer of two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of venus on december of the same year the pioneer venus orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet five days later the five separate components making up the second spacecraft the pioneer venus multiprobe entered the venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet the four small independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to earth during their descent toward the surface although designed to examine the atmosphere one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour venus resembles earth in size physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet however spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well for example venus rotation west to east is retrograde backward compared to the east to west spin of earth and most of the other planets approximately percent of venus atmosphere times as dense as earth s is carbon dioxide the principal constituent of earth s atmosphere is nitrogen venus atmosphere acts like a greenhouse permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space as a result the planet s average surface temperature is degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead a radio altimeter on the pioneer venus orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planet s dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet nasa s magellan spacecraft launched on may has been in orbit around venus since august the spacecraft uses radar mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh resolution images of the surface magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features faults and impact craters huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones an elevated region named ishtar terra is a lava filled basin as large as the united states at one end of this plateau sits maxwell montes a mountain the size of mount everest scarring the mountain s flank is a kilometer mile wide kilometer mile deep impact crater named cleopatra almost all features on venus are named for women maxwell montes alpha regio and beta regio are the exceptions craters survive on venus for perhaps million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion extensive fault line networks cover the planet probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on earth but on venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock which cracks just about everywhere preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the san andreas fault in california venus predominant weather pattern is a high altitude high speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid at speeds reaching as high as kilometers miles per hour the clouds circle the planet in only four earth days the circulation is in the same direction west to east as venus slow rotation of earth days whereas earth s winds blow in both directions west to east and east to west in six alternating bands venus atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather earth as viewed from space our world s distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters brown and green land masses and white clouds we are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of percent nitrogen percent oxygen and percent other constituents the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life earth orbits the sun at an average distance of million kilometers million miles earth is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of venus our planet s rapid spin and molten nickel iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field which along with the atmosphere shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the sun and other stars earth s atmosphere protects us from meteors as well most of which burn up before they can strike the surface active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting earth almost certainly received soon after it formed about billion years ago along with the other newly formed planets it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system from our journeys into space we have learned much about our home planet the first american satellite explorer was launched from cape canaveral in florida on january and discovered an intense radiation zone now called the van allen radiation belts surrounding earth since then other research satellites have revealed that our planet s magnetic field is distorted into a tear drop shape by the solar wind the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the sun we ve learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries and we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere once believed calm and uneventful seethes with activity swelling by day and contracting by night affected by changes in solar activity the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on earth besides affecting earth s weather solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere when charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in earth s magnetic field they collide with air molecules above our planet s magnetic poles these air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights satellites about kilometers miles out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting these watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of earth s complex weather systems from their unique vantage points satellites can survey earth s oceans land use and resources and monitor the planet s health these eyes in space have saved countless lives provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways the moon the moon is earth s single natural satellite the first human footsteps on an alien world were made by american astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless lifeless companion in preparation for the human crewed apollo expeditions nasa dispatched the automated ranger surveyor and lunar orbiter spacecraft to study the moon between and nasa s apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data six two astronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between and carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of kilograms pounds and consisting of more than separate samples from this material and other studies scientists have constructed a history of the moon that includes its infancy rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about billion years old the first few million years of the moon s existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain as a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock the moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects some of the asteroids were as large as rhode island or delaware and their collisions with the moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across this catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the moon at depths of about kilometers miles below the surface then for the next million years from about to billion years ago lava rose from inside the moon the lava gradually spread out over the surface flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that galileo galilei an astronomer of the italian renaissance called maria meaning seas as far as we can tell there has been no significant volcanic activity on the moon for more than three billion years since then the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites by the atomic particles from the sun and stars by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts if our astronauts had landed on the moon a billion years ago they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today thousands of years from now the footsteps left by the apollo crews will remain sharp and clear the origin of the moon is still a mystery four theories attempt an explanation the moon formed near earth as a separate body it was torn from earth it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planet s gravity or it was the result of a collision between earth and an asteroid about the size of mars the last theory has some good support but is far from certain mars of all the planets mars has long been considered the solar system s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface these observations later determined to be optical illusions led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet in when orson welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic war of the worlds by h g wells enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic another reason for scientists to expect life on mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet s surface this phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods so far six american missions to mars have been carried out four mariner spacecraft three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit surveyed the planet extensively before the viking orbiters and landers arrived mariner launched in late flew past mars on july coming within kilometers miles of the surface transmitting to earth close up pictures of the planet the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water mariners and followed with their flybys during the summer of and returned pictures mariners and showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin cold dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide on may the mariner orbiter was launched on a mission to make a year long study of the martian surface the spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift off only to find mars in the midst of a planet wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks but after the storm cleared mariner began returning the first of pictures these revealed previously unknown martian features including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface etching river valleys and flood plains in august and september the viking and spacecraft each consisting of an orbiter and a lander lifted off from kennedy space center the mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet including is there life there nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the viking landers would at least find evidence of primitive life past or present viking lander became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on july while the united states was celebrating its bicentennial photos sent back from the chryse planitia plains of gold showed a bleak rusty red landscape panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue when viking lander touched down on utopia planitia on september it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor one without visible dunes the results sent back by the laboratory on each viking lander were inconclusive small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes while some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet s soil chemistry is there life on mars no one knows for sure but the viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there the viking landers became weather stations recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure few weather changes were observed the highest temperature recorded by either craft was degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit at the viking lander site in midsummer the lowest temperature degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit was recorded at the more northerly viking lander site during winter near hurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms but because the atmosphere is so thin wind force is minimal viking lander photographed light patches of frost probably water ice during its second winter on the planet the martian atmosphere like that of venus is primarily carbon dioxide nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages martian air contains only about as much water as our air but even this small amount can condense out forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys there is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet physical features closely resembling shorelines gorges riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet mars has two moons phobos and deimos they are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient cratered surfaces it is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to mars and were captured by its gravity the viking orbiters and landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of and days respectively the first to fail was viking orbiter which stopped operating on july when a leak depleted its attitude control gas viking lander operated until april when it was shut down because of battery degeneration viking orbiter quit on august when the last of its attitude control gas was used up viking lander ceased functioning on november despite the inconclusive results of the viking biology experiments we know more about mars than any other planet except earth nasa s mars observer spacecraft to be launched in september will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet asteroids the solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the sun but are too small to be considered full fledged planets these objects are known as asteroids or minor planets most but not all are found in a band or belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter some have orbits that cross earth s path and there is evidence that earth has been hit by asteroids in the past one of the least eroded best preserved examples is the barringer meteor crater near winslow arizona asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system one theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago more likely asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet in fact if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object the object would be only about kilometers miles across less than half the diameter of our moon thousands of asteroids have been identified from earth it is estimated that are bright enough to eventually be photographed through earth based telescopes much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of earth asteroids that are on a collision course with earth are called meteoroids when a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor if the meteoroid does not burn up completely what s left strikes earth s surface and is called a meteorite one of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of antarctica of all the meteorites examined percent are composed of silicate stone and percent are composed of iron and nickel the rest are a mixture of the three materials stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks since asteroids are material from the very early solar system scientists are interested in their composition spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination the galileo orbiter launched by nasa in october will investigate main belt asteroids on its way to jupiter the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf and cassini missions will also study these far flung objects scheduled for launch in the latter part of the s the craf and cassini missions are a collaborative project of nasa the european space agency and the federal space agencies of germany and italy as well as the united states air force and the department of energy one day space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials jupiter beyond mars and the asteroid belt in the outer regions of our solar system lie the giant planets of jupiter saturn uranus and neptune in nasa dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock jupiter was the first port of call pioneer which lifted off from kennedy space center in march was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system in december it returned the first close up images of jupiter flying within kilometers miles of the planet s banded cloud tops pioneer followed a year later voyagers and were launched in the summer of and returned spectacular photographs of jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in these travelers found jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium ammonia ice crystals form white jovian clouds sulfur compounds and perhaps phosphorus may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize jupiter s atmosphere it is likely that methane ammonia water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planet s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below because of jupiter s atmospheric dynamics however these organic compounds if they exist are probably short lived the great red spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on earth this hurricane like storm in jupiter s atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet as a high pressure region the great red spot spins in a direction opposite to that of low pressure storms on jupiter it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it the great red spot might be a million years old our spacecraft detected lightning in jupiter s upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to earth s northern lights at the jovian polar regions voyager returned the first images of a faint narrow ring encircling jupiter largest of the solar system s planets jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace once every hours minutes seconds the massive planet takes almost earth years to complete a journey around the sun with known moons jupiter is something of a miniature solar system a new mission to jupiter the galileo project is under way after a six year cruise that takes the galileo orbiter once past venus twice past earth and the moon and once past two asteroids the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into jupiter s cloud layers and relay data back to earth the galileo orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to jupiter s large moons exploring in detail what the two pioneers and two voyagers revealed galilean satellites in galileo galilei aimed his telescope at jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet for the first time humans had seen the moons of another world in honor of their discoverer these four bodies would become known as the galilean satellites or moons but galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planet sized satellites one of the most remarkable findings of the voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the galilean moon io volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than earth the voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on io with plumes of ejected material extending as far as kilometers miles above the moon s surface io s pizza colored terrain marked by orange and yellow hues is probably the result of sulfur rich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tug of war between io jupiter and the other three galilean moons europa approximately the same size as our moon is the brightest galilean satellite the moon s surface displays a complex array of streaks indicating the crust has been fractured caught in a gravitational tug of war like io europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt apparently producing a liquid water ocean this ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space europa s core is made of rock that sank to its center like europa the other two galilean moons ganymede and callisto are worlds of ice and rock ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system larger than the planets mercury and pluto the satellite is composed of about percent water or ice and the rest rock ganymede s surface has areas of different brightness indicating that in the past material oozed out of the moon s interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface callisto only slightly smaller than ganymede has the lowest density of any galilean satellite suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts detailed studies of all the galilean satellites will be performed by the galileo orbiter saturn no planet in the solar system is adorned like saturn its exquisite ring system is unrivaled like jupiter saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen but in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in jovian clouds saturn s atmosphere has a more subtle butterscotch hue and its markings are muted by high altitude haze given saturn s somewhat placid looking appearance scientists were surprised at the high velocity equatorial jet stream that blows some kilometers miles per hour three american spacecraft have visited saturn pioneer sped by the planet and its moon titan in september returning the first close up images voyager followed in november sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of saturn s ring system and moons voyager flew by the planet and its moons in august the rings are composed of countless low density particles orbiting individually around saturn s equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size ranging from dust to house sized boulders the rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock the rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to saturn the unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of saturn s gravity a third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of saturn and its satellites these complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an am car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the voyager spacecraft these emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from saturn s ring system rather than its atmosphere where no lightning was observed as they had at jupiter the voyagers saw a version of earth s auroras near saturn s poles the voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit we learned that some moons shepherd ring particles maintaining saturn s rings and the gaps in the rings saturn s th moon was discovered in from images taken by voyager in voyager determined that titan has a nitrogen based atmosphere with methane and argon one more like earth s in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of mars and venus titan s surface temperature of degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit implies that there might be water ice islands rising above oceans of ethane methane liquid or sludge unfortunately voyager s cameras could not penetrate the moon s dense clouds continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting titan s methane to ethane acetylene and in combination with nitrogen hydrogen cyanide the latter compound is a building block of amino acids these conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval earth between three and four billion years ago however titan s atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry the exploration of saturn will continue with the cassini mission the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called huygens which will be dropped into titan s atmosphere and fall to the surface cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through titan s clouds and will spend years examining the saturnian system uranus in january four and a half years after visiting saturn voyager completed the first close up survey of the uranian system the brief flyby revealed more information about uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planet s discovery over two centuries ago by the english astronomer william herschel uranus third largest of the planets is an oddball of the solar system unlike the other planets with the exception of pluto this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an year swing around the solar system during voyager s flyby the south pole faced the sun uranus might have been knocked over when an earth sized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system voyager found that uranus magnetic field does not follow the usual north south axis found on the other planets instead the field is tilted degrees and offset from the planet s center a phenomenon that on earth would be like having one magnetic pole in new york city and the other in the city of djakarta on the island of java in indonesia uranus atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen with some percent helium and small amounts of ammonia methane and water vapor the planet s blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors wind speeds range up to kilometers miles per hour and temperatures near the cloud tops average degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit uranus sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical smog believed to be a combination of acetylene ethane and other sunlight generated chemicals surrounding the planet s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as electroglow approximately kilometers miles below uranus cloud tops there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some kilometers miles deep beneath this ocean is an earth sized core of heavier materials voyager discovered new moons kilometers miles in diameter orbiting uranus the five previously known miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon range in size from to kilometers to miles across representing a geological showcase these five moons are half ice half rock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity including faulting and ice flows the most remarkable of uranus moons is miranda its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons crater pocked plains and winding valleys the sharp variations in terrain suggest that after the moon formed it was smashed apart by a collision with another body an event not unusual in our solar system which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts what is extraordinary is that miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface uranus was thought to have nine dark rings voyager imaged in contrast to saturn s rings which are composed of bright particles uranus rings are primarily made up of dark boulder sized chunks neptune voyager completed its year tour of the solar system with an investigation of neptune and the planet s moons on august the spacecraft swept to within kilometers miles of neptune and then flew on to the moon triton during the neptune encounter it became clear that the planet s atmosphere was more active than uranus voyager observed the great dark spot a circular storm the size of earth in neptune s atmosphere resembling jupiter s great red spot the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost kilometers miles per hour voyager also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast moving cloud dubbed the scooter as well as high altitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck the highest wind speeds of any planet were observed up to kilometers miles per hour like the other giant planets neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior the planet s core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants neptune s distinctive blue appearance like uranus blue color is due to atmospheric methane neptune s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet s spin axis and is not centered at the core this phenomenon is similar to uranus magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal earth s magnetic field on the other hand is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center voyager also shed light on the mystery of neptune s rings observations from earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet it was not clear how neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even unclumped rings voyager detected these arcs but they were in fact part of thin complete rings a number of small moons could explain the arcs but such bodies were not spotted astronomers had identified the neptunian moons triton in and nereid in voyager found six more one of the new moons proteus is actually larger than nereid but since proteus orbits close to neptune it was lost in the planet s glare for observers on earth triton circles neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days tidal forces on triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet in to million years a short time in astronomical terms the moon will be so close that neptunian gravity will tear it apart forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planet s modest current rings triton s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of io and miranda the moon has more rock than its counterparts at saturn and uranus triton s mantle is probably composed of water ice but the moon s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane the moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain the so called cantaloupe terrain and a receding ice cap dark streaks appear on the ice cap these streaks are the fallout from geyser like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark fine grained particles to heights of to kilometers to miles triton s thin atmosphere only th as thick as earth s has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap the coldest surface yet found in the solar system degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit triton might be more like pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited pluto pluto is the most distant of the planets yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside neptune s orbit where it has been since and where it will remain until march pluto s orbit is also highly inclined tilted degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets discovered in pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball the planet s diameter is calculated to be approximately kilometers miles only two thirds the size of our moon ground based observations indicate that pluto s surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the sun observations also show that pluto s spin axis is tipped by degrees the planet has one known satellite charon discovered in charon s surface composition is different from pluto s the moon appears to be covered with water ice rather than methane ice its orbit is gravitationally locked with pluto so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other pluto s and charon s rotational period and charon s period of revolution are all earth days although no spacecraft have ever visited pluto nasa is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission comets the outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets as asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the sun most comet nuclei reside in the oort cloud a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the sun as a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets these volatile elements are boiling the nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across and is made principally of water ice with methane and ammonia materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets as these materials boil off of the nucleus they form a coma or cloud like head that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across the coma grows as the comet gets closer to the sun the stream of charged particles coming from the sun pushes on this cloud blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comet s tails gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus but dust particles are pushed more slowly as the nucleus continues in its orbit the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc both the gas and dust tails point away from the sun in effect the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the sun the tails can reach million kilometers million miles in length but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase comets from the latin cometa meaning long haired are essentially dramatic light shows some comets pass through the solar system only once but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets these latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system halley s comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet returning on an average of once every years and orbiting from beyond neptune to within venus orbit confirmed sightings of the comet go back to b c this regular visitor to our solar system is named for sir edmond halley because he plotted the comet s orbit and predicted its return based on earlier sightings and newtonian laws of motion his name became part of astronomical lore when in the comet returned on schedule unfortunately sir edmond did not live to see it a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to earth unfortunately on its most recent appearance halley s comet passed no closer than million kilometers million miles from our world the comet was visible to the naked eye especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere but it was not spectacular comets have been so bright on rare occasions that they were visible during daytime historically comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the sun craf will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed the first was nasa s international cometary explorer in an armada of five spacecraft two japanese two soviet and the giotto spacecraft from the european space agency flew by halley s comet in conclusion despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely earth but since spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space we have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years our automated spacecraft have traveled to the moon and to all the planets beyond our world except pluto they have observed moons as large as small planets flown by comets and sampled the solar environment astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations we are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects the knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology by studying the geology of planets moons asteroids and comets and comparing differences and similarities we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole we are also gaining insight into earth s complex weather systems by seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the sun s activity and its influence throughout the solar system we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on earth we will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space one current mission is mapping venus others are flying between worlds and will reach the sun and jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments future missions are planned for mars saturn a comet and the asteroid belt we can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world although astronauts have not been back to the moon since december plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of mars and even the establishment of martian outposts one day taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a lunar base or a martian colony end\n", "label":

{"text": "re gamma ray bursters where are they i feel compelled to complain the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma ray bursts is utterly false even though it is popular enough to make it to batse press releases the idea behind the statement is as follows if you smack two neutron stars together or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole a lot of energy is released enough for a gamma ray burst at a cosmological distance but so the reasoning continues this energy is released below a lot of matter so the radiation becomes thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum the observed spectra are strongly non thermal so this model must be wrong as so often the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model it may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma ray burst but the fireball of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow when this slams into the surrounding medium a strong flux of non thermal gamma rays results which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy all this is not my idea it is in a series of papers by martin rees peter meszaros sorry for the missing accents and co workers it is certainly not a complete model but it may well be the best one around summing over all proposed distance scales an alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball by the way is the so called failed supernovae scenario by stan woosley in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole if the stellar core was rotating part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole this beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis which again constitutes relativistic flow the rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers but the flux may be more strongly beamed so that the net rate of bursts observed on earth stays the same between the two scenarios but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario on another note i do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work and therefore it must be so and so ralph wijers\n", "label": "space"}, {"text": "re long term human

richmond spiff princeton edu stupendous man writes if that s the case let me point out that interstellar dust and molecules provide many instances of things that are well not too far from being blackbodies many different observations including iras and cobe have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures can range from k to k interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies the large grains have sizes of order micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency however at temperatures below k of the thermal emission will be beyond microns where radiating efficiency is poor a small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed moreover the iras observations had a maximum wavelength of microns grains colder than k will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths and iras would be relatively insensitive to them in the extreme limit grains as cold as k will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation worse still iras color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of small grains these grains have only perhaps atoms and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or k of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while but when they are radiating the characteristic temperature is several hundred k even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed average temperature a model for local infrared emission consistent with cobe data has three components these represent scattered radiation from zodiacal dust color temperature k thermal emission from zodiacal dust tc k and thermal emission from galactic dust tc k at the ecliptic poles the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively e e and e the first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane to find the thermal equilibrium temperature we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components then take the fourth root in the table below starlight comes from allen s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to zero mag stars with b v color of no doubt careful work could do much better the person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of e must have been remembering wrong we would be cooked if that were the case in any event the

launch systems for some time a good reference on this might be comparison of propulsion options for advanced earth to orbit eto applications iaf by v a weldon and l e fink from boeing the paper describes a propane fueled tsto launch system claimed to achieve aircraft like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel basically it s a high speed airplane launching a hermes type spaceplane the design the concept is also called beta as laid out in the paper can launch at least pounds into polar orbit or pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support system design reliability is beta is a foot long first stage powered by two large ramjets and high speed civil transport hsct turbofans a foot long reusable orbiter is trapeze mounted in the belly of the first stage aircraft which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage to launch the orbital vehicle the first stage takes off like a normal hsct and accelerates to mach at that point the turbofans modified to burn catalyzed jp would shut off and the ramjets would take over at mach the orbiter or the elv would swing out ignite and proceed to orbit both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about m lbs roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded an the orbiter stages weighs about klbs including klbs of lox and subcooled propane to power two klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines propellants would be stored at degrees kelvin with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the by foot cargo bay and the two seat orbiter crew station lox would be stored aft weldon and fink claim the key to this design s success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel the paper compares tsto design to ssto design they conclude while a ssto has a slightly lower recurring cost a tsto is easier cheaper and less risky to develop simpler to build has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn t carry the hard to handle and bulky hydrogen fuel the conlcude in conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel as well as its inherent self ferry capability it is probably the system most likely to provide as close

sending a probe to barnard s star i e a large bus spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination the saturn v supposedly would have been able to launch a ton payload towards jupiter and beyond the bus could have included far more powerful cameras telescopes scientific equipment and a heavier more powerful power source than the voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore extremely important as the voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter and usually at a relatively great distance the smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the real voyagers and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards pluto in the early st century and would have been released at various points during the mission the advantages are obvious the bus would have carried out the same basic jupiter saturn uranus neptune mission than voyager

in other countries in order for u s industries to compete with government subsidized foreign competitors the u s gov t has taken on the role of subisizing big ticket or long lead r d this definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science some of it is relevant in technology there was little involvement of federal funds or except through support of state universities of state funds for scientific research before wwii the us research position had been growing steadily and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds there were not that many research universities but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads laboratories assistants and equipment and funds for travel to scientific meetings not that much but it was provided and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary during wwii the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems even though they were not exactly in the areas of the scientists expertise this is probably because of the research mind approach which is not to try to find a solution but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges this works in stages and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems the job got done the military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future and started funding pure research after wwii but congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists and set up other organizations such as nsf to do the job it also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out also the government did a job on private foundations making it more difficult for them to act to support research the worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money suppose as has been the case i have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months what do you think happens if i ask for one the answer i will get is get the money from nsf now the money at the university level is a few thousand but at the nsf level it comes to about thousand and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported so the government is in effect deciding which projects get supported and how much also the government decided that the wealth should be spread so instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being and instead of evaluating scholars they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals as a researcher i can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking or as now happens the investigator conceals already done work to release it

appropriate specifications for this program that s not what they told us back in the s it has been a test program from the start a logical follow to the x program and the later x series lifting bodies it isn t a logical follow on a logical follow on would have been either a russian snowfox type thingey for the lifting bodies or something like mmi s space van or boeing s tsto or the airbreathing tsto the military is allegedly using now that probably cost less to develop than the shuttle does to fly for a year the engineering specs that the guys in the trenches had were to develop a system which was man ratable could land reliably and could be reflown these goals were quite visionary for the s and i would argue that they are challenging even today including for the dc x program keep that attitude and it ll be a couple centuries before we get real access to space unless another country without all that baggage comes along and kicks our ass in the space race i do not recall a flight week specification in the final nasa specs for the space shuttle program if you have such documents i would find them most revealing and interesting as far as i can tell the only people touting a flight per week flight rate were people on capitol hill or selling books to the general public or nasa hq that doesn t give the rest of the program plausible deniability if we deceide that it wasn t worth the money we ve spent which is by now probably a lot more than apollo imho political statements in the halls of the us congress are not admissable as engineering specs because specs should be determined by nasa dod and contractors not by congressmen senators or presidents missions are defined by political leaders but not the engineering specs yes but it gets sold on the basis of the political statements you re saying basically that it met the engineering specs which is questionable imho so it s a success never mind that you couldn t get the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in a thousand years the shuttle is the only reusable space vehicle this automatically qualifies it as an unparalleled engineering success you could argue about its political success but engineering wise it is clearly the most advanced machine ever flown i argue that engineering and technical data for hypersonic flight is valuable in and of itself shuttle should be justified or criticized on the basis of economics you can get hypersonic flight data with an x or a follow on x type vehicle for much less and economics and engineering are interchangable engineering in the

will perform as you state but right now i must admit that i am more skeptical than ever it will be tough to make dc x succeed and to turn it into an operational orbital vehicle doubtless it will fail

costs there is no shuttle successor in funded development nasp is dwindling away and als nls spacelifter sure as hell aren t gonna knock any zeroes off that per pound cost part of the blame for this must be placed on a shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the er free world s available space cash as you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come dc x is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental x plane hardware it s been to my mind incredibly successful already they ve built a complex prototype in under days for under megabucks i would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in s america never mind flying the thing getting a successor funded or building the dc y i m

dc flops it ll be business as usual in space the nineties and the double oughts will look just like the seventies and eighties a prospect too depressing to bear pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction it doesn t lower cost per pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks it s creating its own market for small payloads i read the magazines and i ve attended the last two iafs there are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems some of them as good as or better than ssto there is no sign in today s world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line you could change my view on dc x if you could prove the following deleting some things i m not going to prove tonight that the shuttle need

instead of it also of course dc y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are not man rated most importantly that the dc x will open up leo to more scientific and technical payloads if a dc x successor can fly a kg payload for m or even m rather than the m it now costs more people will be able to afford more payloads for the same money you can fly several satellites instead of one big outfits can fly multi satellite series little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own instead of begging a ride this is just supply and demand you

either to comment although everyone tells me i should read nietzche i would have to say that the greatest philosopher title would have to go to plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him although he got most of his answers wrong he did definitively identify what the important questions are i think it was descartes who said that all philosophy is just a footnote to plato if i were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime that s simple it is aristotle this is so much the case that many simply refer to him as the philosopher regarding nietzsche he s one of the most entertaining although since his ideas were so fragmented and since his life was cut short it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive years from now they ll probably still be reading him in years though as for modern philosophers i would have to say that kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him and unfortunately they maintained his errors and amplified them over time i would say that the most influential american

david m palmer writes gary ke zv uucp gary coffman writes lack of a skeleton means that muscles have to actively resist gravity at all times on land rather than supplying only balancing forces that means that much more energy would be required for the creature to function the bones also supply leverage points for pushing and lateral movement that s why you don t find large active boneless creatures on land hydraulics can make rigid tubes no energy required just for support hydraulics also allow a creature to produce large forces with weak muscles using the principle of a hydraulic jack rather than a lever this is one of those yes but things it s true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube but even at psi levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily though it s straight on compressive strength is high and it s torsional resistance increase is practically nil on the other grasping member there s no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature tree roots are an example given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure increases it s interesting to note that on land creatures are either two legged or legged with tiny insects having or legs but never legged though that would be a stable configuration it can be argued that legged creatures kangaroos are legged the specific number of limbs a creature has is an accident of evolution it is hard to make changes in some structures the panda has a thumb plus as many fingers as its ancestors five on each hand but the thumb is a modified wristbone rather than a modified finger and extra fingers are much more common than extra limbs especially fully functional ones kangaroos limbed i don t think so if you take the view that the tail is a limb then monkeys and kangaroos are limbed i think the tail is a different kind of structure grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion i don t know much about panda thumbs so i ll ask is it opposable thermodynamic considerations of surface volume relationships would seem to dictate that active complex creatures stay in a size range similar to what we see about us inch tall intelligent aliens seem unlikely as do those much larger than the elephant why can t a lemur or a brontosaurus be intelligent yes i know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus but so far space aliens are also mythical well i won t say flat out that they can t be intelligent but i ll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why i don t think it s likely first let me say that when i say intelligent i mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with or greater than human tool use and tool building ie assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter it s enviroment in a planned way it will do so that s certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence but it will suffice for a putative technological alien now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought but it s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity this is generally determined by the number of neuron cells and their interconnections so a creature the size of a lemur wouldn t have enough neurons to support complex thought this argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur there s room for a large brain though no indication that one ever developed one reason this may be true is neuronic speed the electrochemical messages that trigger neurons require time to propagate this makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures so there s little selection pressure for such brains instead a simpler distributed network evolves this doesn t rule out intelligent dinosaurs but it points in that direction then there are the thermodynamic arguments a tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it s internal heat is rapidly lost due to it s high surface to volume ratio i contend that a creature that must spend most of it s time and energy feeding won t have the time to develop and exercise intelligence that argument may be somewhat weak the dinosaur s problem is the reverse it must moderate it s heat production because it s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat i m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function so creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based that tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded but for a creature the size of a brontosaur it s activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat whales are similar size but they can reject heat to the ocean a much more efficient sink than air i suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary ie monkey curiousity i doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity gary

don t think the piece of light pollution apparatus would be as bright as the full moon that seems to me to be a bit of propaganda on the part of opponents or wishful thinking on the part of proponents second this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been levelled against other projects that either don t increace light pollution significantly or increace light pollution only over the target area you may or may not recognize as being solar power sattelites i think it was josh hopkins who actually did the math showing that sps s weren t that bright after all ending some two months of frenzied opposition on the part of dark sky activists and various other types is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the cis tested recently while slightly more worrisome i d like to point out that any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be concerned and something any project like that would work against anyway and given some of the likely targets i don t think there s going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants there is too much dark sky in the northern cis during the winter and i
