hendricks writes thanks to kim for following up i was hoping that someone would bring up the issue of cost compensation the problem with the argument is that it fails to explain why kidney dialysis rd services have expanded massively in the last decade after all no one is forcing private providers to offer this service if they are losing money on the treatment which according to information i ve collected from several providers they are not why would they not simply limit their losses by cutting back on services engage in effective rationing of supply rather than expand the coverage to a larger market that must then be compensated by raising prices in other areas perhaps there is a competitive advantage in there after all would not reputable and dedicated physicians prefer to affiliate with an institution that offers dialysis services would they not therefore tend to admit patients in greater numbers to an institution that offered a full range of diagnostic and treatment options undoubtedly in fact it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that in part complicates and undermines a simplistic free market analysis of the market for medical care hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high tech high price machinery they manage to make it up on other charges once again there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients rd is still a profitable service otherwise one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred remember the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an array of products at prices below cost are not grocery stores embedded in a relatively free market can you spell loss leader i knew you could grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it in fact your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained but the evidence does not support this contention rather it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower cost technology to provide comparable benefits providers continue to profit from rd they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have there is no question that had price controls forced the price of rd substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free market advocates would have been seen restriction of service lagging technological development etc likewise it appears that in the va and armed forces medical care systems where providers are government agencies some of these negative impacts may occur rd patients in the va system in spokane for example must travel to seattle miles away for treatment the bottom line however is that this is an example of government intervention of a rather extreme sort that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers claims that government bureaucracy inevitably leads to

thin heterosexualy why then the specific prohibition on homosexuals especially since the answer to everything back then was stoning to death doesn t help population growth much also to just say that their foes were perverts begs the question the key word is spilled if semen was spilled anywhere where there was a chance of procreation it was ok if it was spilt on the ground or in to a man it was a big sin ditto with animals the jews said sex pro creation homosexuals didn t breed there fore they are evil and should be stoned to death all sex was directed towards breeding the jews were few in number and their foes many to survive everything had to go into multiplication like i said stoning to death doesn t help population much it sounds more like a set of prejudices that already existed and were blown into a religion to emphasize the differences of jewish culture and enshrine some pretty stoning non breeding population was fine only the breeders were considered to be worth much jesus

make it clear to the offender that their behaviour is unwanted if the behaviour persists harrassment is much easier to demonstrate due to the fact that the offender knew that the behaviour was unwanted no argument here my original query regarded the question of why the first sexual proposition made by person a to person b would be considered to be sexual harassment by some many people assuming of course that there does not exist a power relationship between a and b such that the proposition carries strong implications of extortion right from word one i can only say that those people are wrong the word harass means to irritate or torment persistently i d hardly consider one time to fall under the definition of persistent additionally there is no basis to assume the behaviour is unwanted unlike an illegal proposition of course i think the original question of offering money for sex is inarguably harrassment because the activity is illegal and could be presumed to be unwanted by the average citizen i have to take issue with this viewpoint given that a prostitution is a victimless crime and b there are literally millions of americans who participate in some sort of victimless activities which the state has defined to be criminal e g prostitution obscenity gambling using certain recreational drugs having non mercenary sex with persons not one s spouse in certain states having unnatural sex with people regardless of marital status or exchange of money in certain states etc i d have to say that the idea that an activity may be presumed to be unwanted by the average citizen merely because it is illegal is the sort of sophistry that only a judge could indulge in with a straight face he said speaking as a law student who s read his share of judicial opinions in which reality was not only denied but in fact actually inverted in order to make the universe conform to the writer s politics i was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint what you say is true but the law in order to make what little sense it manages to make has to make some assumptions assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted by the average citizen i think is reasonable certainly i would need a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome the number of people who participate in victimless crimes notwithstanding the fact reamins that under the law the activity is illegal to presume that the proposition is welcome simply because a large number of people indulge in it is the type of sophistry

large scale plantations slave labor was used to make one of the most valuable agricultural products of all more slaves in some ways this treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying aspect of american slavery second although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to reduce the demands for labor eventually it was only in the s the mechanization of cotton production in the south largely eliminated the labor intensive character of the operation long after the first mechanical cotton reaper was invented this is an interesting question steinbeck s grapes

argument that slavery was a dying institution was often made by is historians mainly southerners who sought to divert attention from the institution as the central issue of the civil war in fact however the argument is specious at best more recent scholarship from the last years demonstrates rather conclusively that the cotton sugar tobacco economy and its reliance on slavery was increasingly dominant in the south prior to the civil war this is because the south did not receive the massive momentum of capital intensive growth that the northern states did compare the northern agricultural system with the southern and you will see a major difference in the capital to labor intensity capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy except that capital doesn t reproduce quite as readily as slaves did slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin yes but not in it is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the s the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the south that is not the argument that i have heard it would not have lasted because the growth in the north would not have been sustained for much longer without spilling over to the southern states i e northern industry would have migrated capital to the southern states and with that would have come immigrant labor to the ports of the south e g charleston savannah mobile new orleans etc this would have put the breaks on the slave market and slavery would have been out moded by the capital intensity of competing agriculturalists those that insisted on keeping slaves because of their cruel hearts and hatred for black people would have been driven out of business simple capital to labor ratio read michael parkin microeconomics nd edition and any other basic economics book this assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the north since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery i do not doubt that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive threat thomas sowell s market and

general charge that is no specific right is mentioned i don t think that this is accurate i believe and could be wrong that there is a specific right allegedly to have been violated like the th or due process or whatever what about double jeopardy has there been any concern that a verdict against koon et al might be overturned upon appeal because they re being tried again for the same actions i thought i heard something on the news about this the ss has previously ruled that since the seperate governments were in essence seperate sovereigns then double jeopardy does not apply if this is true then could defendents also be tried under city and county governments this mornings paper said that the aclu has decided to reinstate its opposition to this kind of thing they had earlier suspended their opposition while they examined the king case there might be hope for the aclu after all double jeopardy does not apply but not for the reasons you quote double jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge however the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force or assault they are now on trial for the different crime of violating mr king s civil rights as for the city and county or state trying you more than once it most likely will not happen this is because cities and states have separate laws governing behaviour for example in some states it is

manson hitler mccarthy jack the ripper ted bundy and a whole slew of individuals who have done horrible evil things if white males can take the credit for our fellow white males boons we must also take the blame for our fellows blights i claim we deserve neither credit nor blame for these things we are told by u s congresswoman barbara jordan that we are biologically incapable of compassion she s full of shit we are told by susan brownmiller that we re all rapists and that s all we are she s full of shit we re told by catherine comins that a false rape charge is actually good for us she s full of shit we are told by the feminist lawyers that we are not to be trusted with children they re full of shit we are told by newsweek magazine that we are poor sports if we complain newsweek is full of shit the point ladies and gents michael is not entirely correct in his theory that because members of our race and gender made great advances the race and gender as a whole deserve more respect than they receive white males do deserve to be treated better than they are being treated but not for that reason and the male bashers he quoted are repugnant hate mongers no better than the chauvinists they despise so no one s right as usual white males need to wake up and realize that they re being unfair yes but everyone else needs to wake up and realize that being unfair right back is disgusting racist and sexist why can t we learn to treat everyone fairly without generalizing what stupidity gene makes this so difficult i d like to buy the world a clue the word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the b word or the h word or even the n or w words it is the l word loser that s right when we boil all the crap out of this argument it is all about winning and losing and nothing else let me explain remember the eighties no excuses nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are too young to remember ronald reagan yet the eighties were about how america learned to win once again then wouldn t you know we won so well that there was nothing left to win no cold war to endure no nuclear holocaust no more worlds to conquer we forgot about outer space long ago the kind of overwhelming no holds barred success that killed alexander the great yes there were a few little problems along the way stock market meltdown here an s l bailout there a few revolts and crazy middle eastern dictators to contend with but as tacitus would tell ya the god augustus never had it so good in the meantime there is guilt for winning maybe a fear that one doesn t deserve one s bounty or success so there is a kinder and gentler type of politician these days bill clinton affirmative action and lots of discourse about people who don t get it for those of us in the winning business this kind of talk is mildly irritating but there is still no suggestion of losing but what do we find now to put it mildy the stereotype of our white male non winner is woody hayes in the rose bowl punching out photojournalists when those california fruits and nuts steal another one with a hail mary pass in the fourth quarter the whole idea behind three yards and a cloud of dust is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period but woody just used his fists uzzies seem to be the weapon of choice these days who is d fens anyway the answer is as plain as the horn rims on your face the guy is michael douglas posing as a loser this is known as controversial casting but that baggy short sleeved white shirt sure does look natural on mike doesn t it gordon gekko will never look the same though woody always dressed that way did we really expect gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe without putting up a fuss what we are starting to lose sight of is that bashing d fens is the same game as bashing that poor african american slug that clint eastwood used to blow away all the time as that arch wasp male gender george c scott declaimed americans traditionally love to win they love a winner and will not tolerate a loser and so on the political implications are simple if as many socialists and democrats do you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some equitable way then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on that could be black women today asian homosexuals tommorrow and yes indeed white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that minority or you can just blow the whole thing off and say as do most conservatives and all the libertarians and act is if you didn t care who s winning and who s losing in some cases you might say something about make sure the game is fair equality of opportunity not of condition in the latter case you might be able to identify yourself as a neoconservative or a neoliberal depending on how much you want to limit the pot either way you go the way of the winner is no longer the way to be popular at least after you graduate from high school but you ll still be popular at high school reunions but it beats being a nerd as i would imagine michael douglas would now agree and in the long run it is the only way to go even in hollywood which treats losers worse than any other place in america except for new york and washington d c and even in columbus ohio which produced alex keaton but

drugs are absolutely bad bad bad and this newsgroup consistently refuses to admit that drugs like heroin even have negative side effects heroin is a relatively safe drug what makes it unsafe are iv administration and shit like adulterants there are side effects like withdrawal but they effect people differently i ve seen numerous posts claiming heroin has lower addiction rates that cigarettes which might be true but it is very deceiving because heroin is much more harmful drug to be addicted to than cigarettes heroin addicts are far more prone to end up in the gutter and destroy their family and friends than people addicted to just cigarettes stereotypical statement i know people who use heroin and opiates that function just fine in society this group does provide some very good information to people but i am worried that the pro legalization pro decriminalization movement is being hurt when it refuses to admit that any some drugs are very harmful name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically i m all for legalization of most drugs but when someone asks me about relative risks of certain drugs or possible bad side effects i would like to know them and not be given the run around by this group which recently tried to tell me that pot was not harmful in any manner to people s lungs no no no or at least i haven t been arguing this there is not enough data to form a scientific conclusion that doesn t mean that cannabis is benign to users lungs we can form all the theories we want but they are only theories some theories are supported by more

one month since war broke out in the south atlantic on the surface it seems that it s only a dispute between argentina and great britain over the barren wind swept falkland islands and south georgia island in reality it s far more than that the so called falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation during this month of april fierce naval battles have taken place not only in the south atlantic but also in the south pacific up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides but as i say these words the naval war in the southern hemisphere is about to come to the surface beginning today april a total naval and air blockade of the falklands by the royal navy has begun at the same time a counterblockade has been declared by argentina in the same area to be effective a blockade must be imposed over a period of time but the royal navy does not have that much time winter is coming on in the south atlantic and the british supply lines are overextended having come this far her majesty s navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from argentina as a result the british will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be there is also another reason why the royal navy now has no choice but to engage the argentine forces in combat that reason my friends is that the royal navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the british fleet only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the british dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses to obtain that cover story the british have no choice but to sail into combat but in doing so they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained in short my friends her majesty s navy has sailed into a trap the events now unfolding in the south atlantic carry strange ironic echoes of the past for weeks now we ve been hearing countless commentators referring to the british task force as an armada quote the british of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description the original spanish armada years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history and it was none other than the english navy that destroyed the spanish armada the original spanish armada put to sea in during the reign of england s queen elizabeth i the armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade england they were met by the daring sea dogs of sir francis drake drake and his small fast ships turned the tables on the spanish armada by changing the rules of battle the english fleet was equipped with new longer range guns and it stayed upwind and out of reach from there the english pounded smashed and shattered the big ships of the mighty armada when it was all over barely half the spanish fleet was left to limp back to port drake s defeat of the spanish armada was a shock to the world it opened the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start its expansion into a truly global empire today years later history seems to have come full circle queen elizabeth ii is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under queen elizabeth i and now the cultures of england and of spain are once again in confrontation once again a so called armada is preparing for invasion but this time the armada is british not spanish four hundred years ago sir francis drake was the hero of the day today the ghost of francis drake is once again on the scene the south atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the drake passage around the southern tip of south america the defeat of the spanish armada four centuries ago broke the back of spain s naval supremacy and now the defeat of the new british armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious royal navy my three special topics for this audio letter are topic the military secret of south georgia island topic the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic the rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war topic when the falkland islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot for a century and a half since the islands have been controlled by great britain during that entire time british sovereignty over the falklands has been disputed by argentina there have been countless threats by argentina to seize the islands which it calls the malvinas but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and britain has never even gotten very worried about them the islands are four times as distant from argentina as cuba is from the united states and they are not much of a prize after years of occupancy the falklands are home to fewer than british settlers and a lot of sheep in short the remote falkland islands hardly look like something to fight over and yet here we are watching another crisis take place we are watching as war erupts between great britain and argentina the thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at nato s doorstep instead britain is throwing almost everything it s got at argentina aircraft carriers cruisers destroyers submarines assault ships you name it luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal nato duty and sent to reinforce the task force the initial ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over over two thirds of the entire royal navy has already been deployed to the south atlantic off argentina watching all this a lot of people are asking what s this fight really all about the most popular answer suggested in the major media is oil vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between argentina and the falklands but that has been known for nearly years in no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by argentina this month and oil explains even less about the argentine seizure of south georgia island south georgia island is miles east of the falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it and compared to south georgia the falklands are an island paradise south georgia island is covered with rugged mountains treacherous valleys glaciers and semi permanent snow most of it is uninhabitable on top of all that argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to south georgia island in that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the falklands in the early s the falklands were occupied for a while by argentine colonists in the british expelled them and took over the island for that and other historical reasons argentina argues that the falklands really belong to argentina not britain but no such argument is possible for south georgia island it has always been controlled by britain never by argentina or spain the argentine seizure of south georgia island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view argentina s leaders are military men and they think in military terms they were well aware ahead of time that far off south georgia island could not possibly be held for long by seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat as the island was retaken by britain so the question is why did argentina s military junta bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia island at all my friends the answers to all these questions are military not political or economic south georgia island possesses an enormous military secret it s a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the island the real reason for the so called falkland crisis is this secret installation together with two other similar installations which i will describe shortly the secret military complexes have been in existence for many years they are not new what is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the american bolshevik war planners here in washington for the past two months i ve been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as i can obtain and verify them the plan calls for nuclear war one to erupt by september of this year it is this fast approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so called falklands crisis to erupt now what is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war the mutual enemies of the american bolsheviks here namely the rockefeller cartel and russia s new rulers in the kremlin are behind the present crisis they are trying to ruin phase of the project z war plan which i revealed last month that phase is to be world domination by the american bolsheviks after both russia and the united states have been destroyed in nuclear war one as i mentioned last month the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world the american bolshevik military planners here in america are working with other bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war having done that they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused safe and cozy in government war bunkers when the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted the bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries they will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open they will confront the world with the only remaining fresh up to date powerful military force on earth and using that military power they will become the undisputed rulers of the world that is they plan to do all this and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off nuclear war one in a matter of months the rockefeller cartel and russia s new anti bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan last month i mentioned that the bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the rockefellers long ago it has only been about three years since the rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the united states government by the bolsheviks since that time the united states government has been a house divided torn by internal power struggles between rival bolshevik and rockefeller factions but before that the united states had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the four rockefeller brothers in the brothers launched a new long range plan for world domination it was a two prong strategy half visible and half secret which i first described long ago in audio letter no it was a plan for the united states to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually without repeating all the details the basic idea was grandiose yet simple by deliberately appearing weak the rockefeller controlled united states would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russia then the secret weapons including superweapons would be unleashed to smash russia and take over the world when they set the grand plan in motion in the rockefeller brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late s their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the northern and southern hemispheres both superpowers the united states and the soviet union are located well up in the northern hemisphere so are the other full fledged nuclear powers great britain france red china and india by contrast the strategic targets for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere are relatively few and far between in other words it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a northern hemisphere war in an all out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war but there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread it was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the northern and southern hemispheres in the northern half of our planet cold air from the north pole works its way southward towards the equator then it works its way back to the north as warm air a mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone but very little of the air changes places the military conclusion my friends is this the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the northern hemisphere for generations to come but if the calculations are right the southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war this was music to the ears of the four rockefeller brothers a quick look at the globe of the world shows why the rockefeller cartel has dominated latin america ever since world war ii as i discussed in my very first monthly audio letter nelson rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on latin america during the war he accomplished this as so called coordinator of hemispheric defense for then president franklin d roosevelt so that takes care of the south american continent and its natural resources then there is the african continent there too rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of black africa especially south of the equator all this was thanks to the efforts of john d rockefeller iii as i detailed in audio letter no looking around the globe the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are australia and new zealand thanks to world war ii both were wide open to the rockefellers the rockefeller brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the southern hemisphere for use after the coming war by this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet earth after the northern hemisphere war then as the northern hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust the rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces in this way the third generation rockefeller brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the earth in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after the war some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass for example revolts against rockefeller domination would require troops not a blast from the beam weapons on the moon the most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy a minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required one based in the south atlantic the other in the south pacific since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the northern hemisphere nuclear war they could not be built in existing shipyards new construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden to hide an entire shipyard is no small task they take up a lot of space on top of that it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built the best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over all secret installation finally the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely the secret navy might be wiped out the combined requirements for secrecy space and protection against attack were formidable but one day in while all these plans were still in the early stages of development the answer presented itself during a so called banking trip to sweden david rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port the port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water the entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships the rockefeller brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger more secret better protected version of the swedish hidden port was just what they wanted a survey of candidate sites was then initiated the site survey covered coastal areas throughout the southern hemisphere many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby making the desired level of secrecy impossible finally it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically at last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected in the south pacific extreme southern new zealand was selected this is what i was alluding to in audio letter no three months ago when i called attention to new zealand s extreme importance in the coming war in order to obtain the necessary space the secret new zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together one is at the extreme southwest tip of south island where the mountain range known as the southern alps comes down virtually to the water s edge the other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of stewart island which is off the tip of south island the stewart island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as mt anglem the new zealand location met all the requirements ever since world war ii the government of new zealand has been tied even closer to the united states than to great britain the location is far from the equator and the installations are buried deep under mountains protected from nuclear attack they are also too deep to be reached by particle beam attacks and the new zealand site is well situated to command the entire south pacific in the south atlantic an even more perfect site was found that site my friends is south georgia island it is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic the tall rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the mile long island it is controlled by great britain whose government like that of new zealand was willing to cooperate and south georgia island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast the whaling station was some miles away from the secret new installation which was being built but britain took no chances in the whaling station was closed down since that time there have been no inhabitants on south georgia island except for a few dozen alleged antarctic scientists construction of the secret naval facilities two in new zealand one on south georgia island began in the early s the techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities such as the norad installation inside cheyenne mountain colorado however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland in this way the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction the cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up when sealed the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is and unlike most large construction projects there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention the man made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea once the secret naval facilities were built they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage the fake disarmament of the united states during the s contributed greatly to this task from to one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate rockefeller scheme he was then secretary of defense robert mcnamara all through the s mcnamara presided over the public paring back of america s visible military power this included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards what we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards where it went my friends was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in new zealand and south georgia island the secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the united states as defense secretary caspar weinberger told congress recently it is cheaper to build two ships at a time that is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first this has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques the secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines they are all nuclear powered nuclear subs nuclear cruisers nuclear destroyers and yes nuclear aircraft carriers three of them a secret twin was built for the u s s nimitz for the u s s eisenhower and for the newly launched u s s carl vincent all have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns so called that we constantly hear about in the defense department and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way the ships of the secret american bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear powered vessels even so the secret naval ships possess one key difference last month i revealed that the so called stealth program has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield this technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity a whole new fleet of phantom war planes are now going into crash production that use this principle and my friends all of the secret american bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar stealth field equipment the stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field after nuclear war one the secret stealth navy of the american bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth it would be perfect for the intended role of world domination the rockefellers set it all in motion long ago my friends but three years ago they lost control of the united states military now it s the american bolsheviks who are in control and they are bent on war these secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the falklands crisis topic in audio letter r no last month i described project z the new bolshevik three phase strategy for nuclear war one an elite group of american bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war room here in washington it s a plan by which the united states will strike the first nuclear blow followed by all out thermonuclear war with russia having set off the holocaust the bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers finally after nuclear war one fizzles out in stalemate they plan to leave behind the ashes of the united states and her allies activating phase of their grand strategy they plan to unveil their secret weapons especially their secret naval fleets with these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world the united states as we know it will be dead and gone but in the eyes of the bolsheviks themselves this outcome will constitute victory up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first revealed two months ago is still on track they are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by september of this year time is fast running out the bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war but my friends the bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race they have two deadly enemies both of whom are equally determined to trip up the bolsheviks one enemy of the bolsheviks here is the rockefeller cartel the other enemy is the new anti bolshevik ruling clique in russia and now these two mutual enemies of the bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways in audio letter no three months ago i reported that a limited new anti bolshevik coalition was in the works between the rockefeller cartel and the russians the january meeting between haig and gromyko in geneva switzerland was a turning point in the formation of this coalition it is now a reality and is responsible for the so called falkland crisis now dominating the headlines it should be emphasized that this new relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russia falls far short of a true alliance they have very major disputes to be settled between them but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy the bolsheviks here in america the first priority of the russians and the rockefellers is to slow down the bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war if they can do that time is on the side of the rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which i discussed last summer in audio letter no a slow down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti bolshevik actions to be implemented the joint rockefeller russian planners decided by mid february that military action against the bolsheviks was essential very quickly no other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer the exact details of the project z war plan are not known to either the rockefellers or the russians but the general outlines are known to be as i described last month it was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine phase of the bolshevik war plan that is the bolshevik controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the southern hemisphere should be attacked and crippled by working together the rockefeller cartel and the russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone the rockefeller group who built and originally controlled these bases provided detailed intelligence about the best way to attack them the russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack it was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the south atlantic and south pacific to be attacked survival intact of either fleet would leave the bolshevik war plan still workable military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the new zealand facilities was out of the question there was no combination of commandos frogmen or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world any attack on the new zealand bases would set off the very war which the rockefellers and russians want to prevent but the situation in the south atlantic was a different matter in a way the greatest asset of south georgia island was also its achilles heel the extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the south georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible the key lay with argentina and her long standing claims to the falkland islands as i mentioned in topic the rockefeller cartel has dominated all of latin america for decades cartel operatives were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there the historic dispute over the falkland islands was to be used to provide a ruse a military cover to enable the south georgia base to be attacked the argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do as an inducement to cooperate the argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards they were guaranteed that after the shooting was over the falkland islands would remain in argentine hands this guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the royal navy and to bolster the troubled argentine economy it was promised that the rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves with these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards the argentine military junta agreed to the plan on march argentina carried out act in the joint attack plan a group of argentine scrap metal merchants of all things landed at the abandoned old whaling station on south georgia island supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell while they were at it they also raised the argentine flag over the work site the british always nervous about south georgia island promptly reacted as expected the british antarctic survey ship endurance put marines ashore they drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the argentine flag the incident provided the desired excuse for the argentine junta to bring the simmering year old falklands dispute to a boil from time to time in the past argentina has claimed that south georgia is part of the falklands because it is administered that way by britain that argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy it was nothing new to hear this from argentine leaders so there was no hint of what was really afoot during late march argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the falklands nothing new thought the british high command argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times it was believed that they were about to do it again but on april argentine forces did the unexpected after many past false alarms this time they actually invaded and seized the islands all argentine public statements emphasized the long standing historical claims to the falklands themselves but just for good measure the next day a small argentine force also seized far off south georgia island the force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from argentina s point of view however the small contingent of royal marines were overpowered and bundled off the island along with a group of alleged scientists that was the moment of payoff in the joint rockefeller russian attack plan thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine forces a special commando team got onto the island undetected based on the detailed rockefeller information about the base the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base special high speed drilling equipment was set up by the rockefeller members of the team while the russian members concentrated on military defense by late that evening april the military high command in london finally learned what was really taking place the secret south georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible the joint rockefeller russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside it was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base once the hole was made the next step was obvious the rockefeller russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole the best guess was that it would be a nerve gas the shock waves that went through the highest levels of the british government on the evening of april can hardly be described my friends the thatcher government like the so called reagan administration here in america is bolshevik controlled that s why margaret thatcher always says me too any time the reagan administration says or does anything against russia both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries and on the evening of april they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep deep trouble immediately the thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the south atlantic haste was the order of the day the drilling on south georgia island was proceeding around the clock the best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks on or about april if help did not reach south georgia by then the secret installation might be doomed the forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle they did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons to open the blast proof entrance doors would be suicide on april just two days after south georgia island was seized some naval ships began moving out of british ports the same day lord carrington was sacked as foreign minister he was forced to resign my friends because he had assisted the rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the argentine attack preparations that same day april new zealand the home of the other secret naval fleet broke diplomatic relations with argentina the two hidden new zealand facilities had been placed on red alert as a precautionary measure all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea several surface ships were already at sea undergoing sea trials but that still left seven major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier on that busy day of april argentina s foreign minister costa mendez was at the united nations in new york he was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy costa mendez hurried here to washington to seek reassurances from certain officials he got them for the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while negotiations went on that my friends was only a cover story the royal navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward south georgia island if the task force arrived in time to save the secret base a major battle was likely the official stories about slow movement of the british armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle if need be the fleet would have several days to retake south georgia island then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the announced schedule in this way the crucial importance of south georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserved it was initially expected that advance elements of the british fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two weeks that would have been soon enough to attack the joint rockefeller russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed but russian cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan key advance elements of the south georgia attack contingent left ascension island early april two days before it was announced officially shortly after they did so they ran into trouble russian cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on south georgia island the cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation in moments the ship was without any command its communications and radar silenced then a russian sub closed in and quickly finished off this key british ship with torpedoes it broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly so far as is known there were no survivors this unexpected shock in the mid atlantic produced two results both important first it caused a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic by the british armada the task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense but that cost valuable time public announcements from london about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown the timetable for arrival on battle stations near the falklands started stretching out longer and longer all this bought extra time for the joint commando team on south georgia island the drilling continued the other result of the sinking was equally important word was flashed to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible action it was obvious that the russian navy was getting involved in the atlantic which meant that the royal navy could be in big trouble during the dead of night early april the seven stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern new zealand they deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the antipodes islands miles southeast of new zealand their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack these shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it as i explained last month but once they arrived at the antipodes the stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the island headquarters the antipodes headquarters in turn was in constant touch with the south georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of south america the deployment of the available ships of the south pacific stealth fleet was exactly what the joint rockefeller russian planners had hoped for the ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in new zealand the british ship s sinking of april was also followed by other events on april the argentine navy started moving out of port the same day alexander haig arrived again in buenos aires supposedly he was there as a diplomat but in reality he was there as a general dealing with generals haig is the top governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel as i have revealed in the past he was making sure that the argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment four days later april haig left for washington as he boarded his plane haig somberly told reporters time is running out and so it was my friends for the secret south georgia base the very next day april the drill broke through into the hollowed out cavern of the naval base bolshevik military analysts in london had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend the british fleet was still out of range the weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small compact russian neutron bomb when it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave the effects were devastating the intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them meanwhile russian cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the stealth ships which were near the antipodes islands awaiting orders from a distance the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields which also protect against beam weapon attack but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the russians employed floating overhead the cosmospheres located the seven ships using their psychoenergetic range finding equipment known as prf as i have reported in the past there is no method known by which prf can be jammed the cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines the subs were armed with special non homing non nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact more sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode within minutes after the attack began all seven bolshevik stealth ships were on their way to the bottom and with them went their bolshevik commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world the south pacific action took place just after sunset local time the time here in washington was around p m april that evening secretary of state haig was seen briefly in public with the new british foreign minister francis pym pym was wearing the artificial pseudo smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public but not haig haig was grinning from ear to ear and no wonder the joint rockefeller russian military operation had been a brilliant success the secret bolshevik south atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out bottled up inside south georgia island and the south pacific fleet while not totally wiped out had been badly crippled by working together the rockefeller cartel and the russians had won the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic as i say these words news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the south atlantic but the real war in the southern hemisphere is already over what we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath that aftermath is the battle for the falkland islands they have been promised to argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war at this moment the bolsheviks here in washington are pressing for a public announcement that the united states will side with britain as soon as that takes place military action will heat up fast around the falklands britain has no choice but to fight she has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle but by fighting the bolsheviks in britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the royal navy meanwhile the rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast building anti nuclear war campaign on all sides now we are hearing about the so called nuclear freeze movement there are documentaries articles publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war in recent months there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war we are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously we are now years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time if you believe that my friends i give up movements like this never and i mean never develop without leadership organization and money and plenty of it what we are watching is the rockefeller public relations machine at work as i ve explained in the past the rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place if it does they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it instead the deadly enemies of the rockefeller cartel the bolsheviks here will win out if there is a war and so the rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war the present anti nuclear war orientation of the rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and russia but as russia s new rulers know very well this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the rockefeller group it s purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the rockefellers the russians regard the united states as a house divided and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the rockefellers their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly bolshevik menace of all out even suicidal nuclear war but once that is done they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the rockefeller cartel some day the rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti nuclear war propaganda that objective is renewed power and power that moves them closer to their old dream of world government the bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new rockefeller antiwar campaign under bolshevik control the so called reagan administration has become so hawkish that it s scaring people the rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power these days the smell of war is in the air the falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense the rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war a new super united nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill it will have teeth as presently envisioned the new organization will be based in geneva switzerland the working name though this may be changed is the world nonproliferation council the plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties but its true purpose will be to use fear the fear of war to control us all last minute summary now it s time for my last minute summary in this audio letter i have reported on the reasons behind the so called falkland islands crisis the crisis erupted because of secret bolshevik controlled naval installations in the southern hemisphere these have been attacked by joint action of the rockefeller cartel and the russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear war timetable the attacks were successful but the results remain to be seen one result though is that the royal navy has now been drawn into a trap britain s waterloo at sea may well be at hand my friends two factions are struggling for control over our united states the rockefeller cartel and the bolsheviks they differ in style but both seek to control us through fear if we are ever to rise above their trickery it must be through the power of our lord jesus christ our only hope as the scripture tells us our lord has not given us the spirit of fear but of power of love and of a sound mind we must learn to wage peace as our lord declared long ago blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god until next month god willing this is dr beter thank you and may god bless each and every one of

press conference by the president with russian press canada place vancouver british columbia p m pdt q i had two questions for both presidents so you could probably answer for boris too laughter the president i ll give you my answer then i ll give you yeltsin s answer laughter q the first is that this is the meeting of the presidents so the money that s being promised is government money and naturally it s going to be distributed through the government but you ve indicated that three quarters are going to be going to businesses so the question is how the russian businesses themselves are going to be consulted if ever what are the priorities because there are several association of russian businessmen existing already so will they be invited to participate in setting up priorities for investment this is the first and second to you we know that polls public polls in america do not show that americans are very enthusiastic about giving this aid like newsweek polls say that about percent don t approve it and new york times published that percent support if it just prevents civil war percent if it fosters democratic reform and only percent if it just personally supports yeltsin how are you going to sort of handle this problem that americans themselves are not very enthusiastic thank you q i have a question i m sorry is there going to be a translation of everything into russian no just the answers just the answers okay the president the answer to the first question is it depends on what kind of aid we re discussing for example the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be good risks and make the application the privatization fund will be used to support the privatization of existing public enterprises then there are some other general funds in the democracy corps and other things which people in russia will have some influence over the distribution of with regard to your second question let me say that i would think that there would be people in both countries who would not feel too warmly toward simply the american government giving money to the russian government there s opposition to that in russia and in our country throughout our whole history there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds that is this has nothing to do with russia if you look at the whole history of america any kind of aid program has always been unpopular what i have tried to tell the american people is is this is not an aid program this is an investment program that this is an investment in our future we spent trillion trillion on armaments on soldiers and other investments because of the cold war now with a democratic government in russia with the newly independent states the remainder of them working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies going it seems to me very much in our interest to make it possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive for the economy of russia to grow because of the potential for trade and investment there and for us to continue the effort to reduce nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides on our side and on the russian side so i don t see this as an aid program this is an investment for the united states this is very much in the interest of the united states the things i announced today the second stage of the program which i hope to put together next week in my view are things that are good for my country and for the taxpayers and workers of my country russia is a very great nation that needs some partnership now some common endeavor with other people who share her goals but it would be a great mistake for anyone to view this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue that s not what it is it s an investment for america and it s a wonderful investment like all investments there is some risk but there s far less risk with a far greater potential of return than the trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier of the cold war q mr president first of all thank you very much indeed for coming here and talking to us in the memory of the living correspondents this is the first time an american president is doing this to the russian press corps so it s kind of a very measured breakthrough i have two questions one in your introductory remarks of the other press conference you mentioned in brief that you discussed the start ii and start i issues could you tell us did you reach an agreement with president yeltsin as to what might be done in order to have ukraine join the ratification of start i and the npt regime and my second question is how confident you are that the united states congress would be eager to support you in lifting jackson vanik and other restrictions inherited from the cold war president clinton first we discussed the issue of ukraine with regard to start i and npt and generally with regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent states all be non nuclear but also to have the united states develop strong relationships with them we know that one thing that we could do that would increase i think the willingness of the ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium because that would provide not only an important economic opportunity for russia but also for ukraine and it would show some reaching out on our part but we agreed that basically the people who signed off on the lisbon protocol have got to honor what they did and we agreed to continue to press that i myself have spent a good deal of time trying to reassure ukraine s leaders specifically the president and the foreign minister that i want strong ties with ukraine that the united states very much wants a good relationship with ukraine but that in order to do what we need to do together to strengthen the economy of ukraine and to have the united states be fully supportive the commitment to ratify start i and to join the npt regime is critical what was the second question the president with regard to jackson vanik and cocom i would make two points first i have agreed with the republican and democratic leaders in the congress that we will as soon as i return have a list of all the legislative and other restrictions some of them are regulatory in nature imposed on relations between the united states and russia that are legacies of the cold war and we will see whether they re how many of them we could agree to do away with right now at least among the leadership of the congress with regard to jackson vanik i think there will be an openness to change the law if the congress is convinced there are in fact no more refusniks no more people who wish to emigrate who are not being allowed to if the fact is that there is no one there who would have been who the law was designed to affect then i think that the desire to keep the law will be much less with regard to cocom my guess is and it s nothing more than a guess that the leadership of congress and indeed my own advisers might prefer to see some sort of phased movement out of the cocom regime but i think they would be willing to begin it in the fairly near future q mr clinton when i read your speech in annapolis i got the impression that you have a completely different personal and i stress that personal not political approach towards russia compared to the approach of mr bush could you formulate in a few words what is the difference between you as a personality and your approach the difference between your approach to russia and the approach of mr bush and who made you why did you cite akhmatova in the last part of your speech the president let me say first i do not wish to compare myself with president bush or anyone else i can t say what was in his heart about russia i can say that since i was a boy i have been personally fascinated with the history the music and the culture and the literature of russia i have been thrilled by russian music since i was a serious student of music for more than years now i have read major russian novelists and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know as much as i could about your history and i went to the soviet union but it was then the soviet union you may know it was a big issue in the last presidential campaign that i spent the first week of alone in moscow and did not return again until three days before mr yeltsin was elected president but all that time i was away i was following events there very closely and hoping for the day when we could be genuine partners so i have always had a personal feeling about russia i remember for example a lot of you know i like music very much one of the most moving experiences for me as a musician was when leonard bernstein took the new york philharmonic to moscow and played shostakovich s fifth symphony to the russians and he played the last movement more rapidly than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically so difficult that is something i followed very closely when it occurred these are things that have always had a big impact on my life and i had just always hoped that someday if i ever had the chance to i could play a role in seeing our two countries become closer partners applause

right when we boil all the crap out of this argument it is all about winning and losing and nothing else let me explain in the meantime there is guilt for winning maybe a fear that one doesn t deserve one s bounty or success so there is a kinder and gentler type of politician these days bill clinton affirmative action and lots of discourse about people who don t get it for those of us in the winning business this kind of talk is mildly irritating but there is still no suggestion of losing who is d fens anyway the answer is as plain as the horn rims on your face the guy is michael douglas posing as a loser this is known as controversial casting but that baggy short sleeved white shirt sure does look natural on mike doesn t it gordon gekko will never look the same though woody always dressed that way did we really expect gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe without putting up a fuss what we are starting to lose sight of is that bashing d fens is the same game as bashing that poor african american slug that clint eastwood used to blow away all the time as that arch wasp male gender george c scott declaimed americans traditionally love to win they love a winner and will not tolerate a loser and so on since we are talking in theory and opinion then i ll put in my first a rebuttle personally i love under dogs unlike bandwagon jumpers i abandon teams when they start winning people that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative the political implications are simple if as many socialists and democrats do you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some equitable way then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on that could be black women today asian homosexuals tommorrow and yes indeed white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that minority on this one point i agree the reason that people bash wasp s is because they have been on top for a long time whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top if hannibal had pushed on to rome after his victory at cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people for all these centuries i seriously doubt that if the blacks had conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better worse than the whites did the white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world but they only did what any other conquering race would have done ie khan the real question is should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn t participate in the crimes would it do any good has it done bosnia any good they are fighting wars that stopped hundreds even thousands of years ago my opinion is if there are inequities now then let s change them but don t blame me for what my ancestors did it wouldn t settle anything anyway either way you go the way of the winner is no longer the way to be popular at least after you graduate from high school but you ll still be popular at high school reunions but it beats being a nerd as i would imagine michael douglas would now agree and in the long run it is the only way to go that s where you are dead wrong you don t join up on a side just because they are winning that makes you spineless winning in high school and after high school is still the best way to be popular but it doesn t make you right all the best causes in history were loosing causes with only a couple exceptions winning only makes a difference to other people not to yourself and what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear ie a winner if you can t beat

is soon to be on his way on amtrack to camden yards he ll be throwing out the first pitch q it s marc the maryland area transit it s not amtrack mr stephanopoulos oh it s not amtrack well he s going from union station you re right excuse me q george what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with senate mr stephanopoulos well as you know there are discussions between senator mitchell and senator dole this morning and i think that the president is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as possible we need this investment for summer jobs for immunization for highway construction for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this summer and the president continues to believe his program should be passed q will he compromise that s the question mr stephanopoulos well as you know the discussions are going on this morning in the senate betwen senator mitchell and senator dole let s see what they come up with but the president believes his jobs program should go forward q george would the president be willing to accept billion for one year which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by mr stephanopoulos well i don t know what is being offered by either side the senate discussions are going on right now let s see what happens today q would he go that far no matter what the republicans have offered so far would he go that far billion per year mr stephanopoulos the president believes that his program should be passed at this time clearly we re going to be willing to listen to what the senators might or might not be able to come up with but i m not going to get into figures right now let s see what happens q it s reasonable to assume isn t it from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote mr stephanopoulos well the republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the president s jobs bill than in doing something to create mr stephanopoulos well the republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the president s jobs bill than in doing something to create real action real jobs this summer for the american people i think there s no question about that there s been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few days q so you ll need to compromise to get your package through mr stephanopoulos we ll see what happens with the conversations between senator mitchell and senator dole this morning q prepared to compromise mr stephanopoulos the president s prepared to listen to what senator mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with senator dole q does he feel that he has been defeated in his mr stephanopoulos not in the least in fact he s been very successful so far in the beginning of his term q how mr stephanopoulos he passed his budget in record time in six weeks and it s a budget which reduces the deficit by billion over five years and it s a budget which provides for important investments in our future right now we ve also had strong passage of his jobs program through the house simply because a minority of republicans in the senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the president s jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding overall q he can t beat this can he q the fact is they can do that mr stephanopoulos well the republicans can stop action there s no question about that q what are you going to do about it q george what do you know about these alleged notes taken by boris yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the president told boris yeltsin not to trust the japanese that when they say yes they mean no mr stephanopoulos i think that s a complete misreading of what happened at the meeting the context of the conversation was that president clinton was actually reassuring president yeltsin at the time about his conversations with prime minister miyazawa over the kuril islands and the prime minister s belief that japan would play a constructive role in the g process i mean this was a casual comment about japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring president yeltsin that he believed the japanese were serious about their commitment to the g process q are you saying that the president said that when the japanese say yes they mean no mr stephanopoulos that s not i don t know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue prime minister miyazawa intends to really go forward with the g process q have there been any attempts to explain this to the japanese because apparently the japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be mr stephanopoulos i ve seen the reports in the japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context it does talk about the japanese understanding the japanese points of view i don t think it s going to be a problem i believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but i m not positive q george was the specific comment that was made specific to the kuril island situation or was it a general observation on japanese etiquette mr stephanopoulos the discussion was about q the specific comment is what i m asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the russian notes when the japanese say yes they mean no mr stephanopoulos well it was a combination i mean i don t think that s the whole sentence i think that the specific comment was a broad general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that prime minister miyazawa means to keep the commitment q was he saying it facetiously first mr stephanopoulos i think it was just a casual observation q and then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it up has the president sent a message mr stephanopoulos no i don t think the president spoke i believe that secretary christopher has made some calls but i m not sure exactly how many q well this obviously is a bigger deal than you re making it out to be if christopher has had to make some calls mr stephanopoulos no no it was just that we got the reports in vancouver and the secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no mr stephanopoulos reports in vancouver and the secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding and i don t believe there is on q what is our position about the japanese that they may have to say one thing but actualy mean another mr stephanopoulos no the position on the japanese is as the president stated to president yeltsin throughout the two days he said that he had had a good conversation with prime minister miazawa prior to the summit he reiterated the u s position the long standing support for the japanese position on the kuril islands but also reiterated prime minister miazawa s commitment to move forward on the g process and to play a constructive role and i think president yeltsin was very glad to hear that q after listening to secretary christopher on iraq for the last few days i m a little confused what is the u s policy do you want to see saddam hussein overturned mr stephanopoulos it s the same policy that secretary christopher has reiterated and all of the u s officials have reiterated we expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all u n resolutions right now we do not have that compliance q throwing it out further that if iraq complies saddam can t stay in office mr stephanopoulos right i think that that s our judgment is that it is not possible for saddam hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in power but the important point is that we expect compliance by iraq with all u n resolutions and we will continue to demand it q and are you concerned the iran will become the dominant power in the area mr stephanopoulos secretary christopher has also spoken to iran over the last several days and he says we also expect full iranian compliance with all international norms and stopping support of terrorism q that s a very glib statement that he won t stay in power if he complies with u n resolutions on what logic do you base that mr stephanopoulos right now saddam hussein is not complying with the u n resolutions at all he is not respecting the rights of his people as is required by the u n resolution he is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections he is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding armaments q well when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power mr stephanopoulos well right now his power rests on the repression of his people if he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power q george back on the stimulus package why is it that you and the president accuse the republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock why is it that what evidence do you have that they just don t have a genuine idealogical difference with you that s in good faith mr stephanopoulos well the fact that several times in the past the republicans many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster have supported the very funding they now seek to stop most especially the highway funding q george in regards to that some of the moderate republicans said that the white house erred by not being more open to them during the while the plan was put together that they had one sort of proforma meeting between the white house and the senate republicans and that was it does the administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some mr stephanopoulos well i m not sure that it s true that there was only one meeting i mean the president met with the republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his package he met with the entire senate republican caucus also for lunch and went up there we are continually in contact with as many republicans as we can find who have an interest in the president s package we are interested in what they have to say as well but we believe that this program is important and we re going to continue to fight for it q your all or nothing do it with the democrats alone strategy did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through mr stephanopoulos well i mean i think that there is no question that under the senate rules a determined minority can frustrate activity i mean there is just no question about that you only need plus one to keep going plus one to keep going and to stop any action and that s what the republicans are doing q going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer q work with republicans and try to woo some republicans into your camp mr stephanopoulos i think we re going to continue to look for the support of republicans whenever we can get it on the president s intiatives q but on this one how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really didn t need republican votes are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes when you have to go through mr stephanopoulos i can t see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road clearly the president s going to continue to reach out when he can q you don t have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you don t plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the republicans in congress based on this experience mr stephanopoulos obviously the president would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he s going to continue to press for that we will continue to reach out to republicans there s not question about that and we ll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation in this case the republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward q they re being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals forward mr stephanopoulos i think they re being q any ideas mr stephanopoulos i think their amendments are being defeated i don t know that they re being denied q to present them mr stephanopoulos that s not exactly true i mean they get the votes q that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they re playing mr stephanopoulos unless they get a majority in support all the way around no that s not exactly true q george one more on iraq is the administration backing any of the iraqi opposition grooming any new leadership q backing any of the iraqi leadership mr stephanopoulos oh i again we re pressing for iraqi compliance i don t know if we can get into the business of grooming leadership i believe there have been some contacts at some levels with iraqi opposition groups i don t know about anything recently q jesse jackson who of course is not the president s best friend has however been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting or some kind of involvement by the president pre empted the ball game los angeles will he consider something like that or any other kind of intervention there mr stephanopoulos well as you know the president appointed commerce secretary ron brown about days ago to be a special envoy to california and coordiante cabinet activities around the california economic situation including the situation in los angeles i believe there will also be visits out to los angeles by the education or have been visits by the education secretary mr riley i believe that transportation secretary pena and hud secretary cisneros are also going out and there may be other visits by cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks i wouldn t rule out the possibility of a visit by president clinton to california obviously he is following the situation closely and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent disturbances but we re going to continue to watch it q george as a follow up reverend jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today in baltimore with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball management does the president have a position on that mr stephanopoulos the president has received correspondence from reverend jackson i know that reverend jackson has also spoken with the white house chief of staff mack mclarty he clearly raises serious questions there has been some progress in baseball over the last several years but still not enough but the president intends to continue to go to the ball game q is he going to say anything about it today or see reverend jackson while he s out there mr stephanopoulos i don t know if he is going to see them but as i said the president believes that reverend jackson has raised some serious questions and it s something that as i said even though there has been progress it s clearly not enough q did reverend jackson ask him not to go to the ball game mr stephanopoulos i m not sure about that i believe the characterization the reverend jackson is talking about is an informational pickett i don t know that he asked him not to go to the ball game but he sent a long detailed formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the president read it q george the orioles are playing the rangers the managing partner of the rangers is george w bush is he going to be there and is he going to meet with the president mr stephanopoulos i don t know q what is the mubarak schedule mr stephanopoulos i know that president mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting they will have a lunch and i believe that he is having dinner tonight with vice president gore q and joint statements tomorrow mr stephanopoulos i believe so yes at the end yes q is there evidence george that the egyptians did warn the u s about a potential terrorist bombing terrorist activities mr stephanopoulos as reported in the new york times i mean i think that president mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the egyptians as there have been for a long period of time we do have general intelligence sharing i mean but president mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward the president will continue to investigate the situation but he also reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind q george he did make specific or the egyptians apparently did issue specific warnings about this individual who forgive me this individual who forgive me the name escapes me at the moment and said the egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of action mr stephanopoulos again i don t know if i would agree with your characterization of the mubarak interview he did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the united states and upon which we took appropriate action but there was no specific information on this specific operation at all q so the white house doesn t feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the cia or fbi who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of mr stephanopoulos no not at all q what s next with serbia it got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday mr stephanopoulos you didn t get to ask your question q yes exactly was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries and even if there wasn t what does the u s do next mr stephanopoulos i think the u s is clearly going to move forward in the u n today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we ll continue to look for ways to press the serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an agreement q george why do you think sanctions is still an option i mean the serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there s no evidence that they re going to have an effect any time soon the bosnian serbs have said no to the peace plan when does no mean no and you have to do something different mr stephanopoulos well i mean we are doing something different we re moving forward on further sanctions through the u n and those discussions will continue we re going to continue to try and tighten the noose on serbia and i think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time q are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo mr stephanopoulos the president has said that this is something that is under consideration q george do you have any more on hugh rodham s condition how he s doing mr stephanopoulos as far as i know nothing s changed q george week after mr mubarak mr stephanopoulos it s a little unclear i think we ll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the mubarak visit q is he going somewhere for easter mr stephanopoulos not that i know of q what more can you tell us about the additional aid to russia that the president plans to ask congress about mr stephanopoulos he s going to be consulting with the congress and with our g partners over the next couple of weeks i know that he spoke last evening with congressman gephardt and their delegation before the the congressional delegation meets with the russians this week and those consultations will continue over the next several weeks q do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announced sunday mr stephanopoulos i m not going to discuss the magnitude q how about the list of cold war restrictions where do you stand on that mr stephanopoulos as the president said yesterday he s going to be looking for that list from the congress this week and reviewing it he believes he s going to try and get it this week and he s going to review the list and we re going to take a hard look at it q but they re making it up i mean it s no white house involvement congress is compiling this list mr stephanopoulos i think he s going to talk to the congressional leaders about compiling the list but i m certain we ll be able to get our own researchers working as well q george isn t lifting the arms embargo more of a probability than a possibility mr stephanopoulos it s something that s under discussion q secretary christopher has said that it s a matter of time and for months before that happens mr stephanopoulos again all i can say is that it s something that the president is reviewing right now we re working with our allies in the u n on a sanctions resolution and we ll continue to review other matters q george can you tell us anything about the schedule this week any travel mr stephanopoulos they just asked about that i don t have anything more beyond tomorrow s visit with mubarak right now q are there consultations george with any jewish american organizations concerning jackson vanick mr stephanopoulos as you know the national conference of soviet jewry has

lot of republican senators who have told people that they might vote for the stimulus program but there s enormous partisan political pressure not to do it and of course what it means is that in this

houston and pittsburgh and philadelphia and portland and seattle it s very sad i mean the block grant program was designed to create jobs in a hurry based on local priorities and it s one that the

non interventionist policy if market reform does happen russia will certainly get private capital at private risk to help their economy they will even have incentive to do so for the same reason if they don t reform then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them then their s the ideological point we want to win russia over to our type of government a type where the rulers can rule without limit over everyone s finances it s like subsidizing the wealthy countries japan germany etc with free defense and then trade warring with them because of the economic competition it s like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke better to let them degenerate into civil war remember all those nuclear weapons in russia i cannot imagine that they would not be used in a civil war if nationialists take over and even if they prevent a civil war most feel they must take back large parts of land that are in other countries like ukraine i also cannot imagine ukraine giving up land without a fight possibly nuclear how does this affect us well we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of

what legitimate constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries seriously seriously everyone has different opinions on what is stupid my two causes are aid to russia and a strong space program someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish that is why we have a republic and not a true democracy instead of gridlock on a massive scale we only have gridlock on a congressional scale it seems instead of gridlock on any scale we have aid to russia expensive space programs national

want to impose their morals on others just the sort of thing i thought libertarians were against that was an opinion and libertarians are very big on free speech actually my politics are pretty libertarian except on this one issue and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party it seems that libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim if you are

who s advocating that hate crimes laws are aimed at the motivations of the acts just like premeditated homicide is treated stricter than heat of passion homicide but you still get into trouble for example how often are crimes of violence not hate crimes the question is then who are you hating if its another gang member then its better than if the person you hate is of a differnt color also is it realistic to declare that crimes of hate are worse than crimes of gross negligence like random drive by shootings where they can t be hate crimes because the shooter doesn t know who he is going to hit he just shoots into the crowd no it is not double jeopardy a single act may lead to multiple charges and multiple crimes i think what you meant to say here was with the current mutation of the us

background briefing by senior administration officials april canada place vancouver british columbia a m pst folks we re about to start the background briefing on the aid package senior administration official good morning the president president clinton and president yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of american initiatives to support economic and political reform in russia and it s valued at billion before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package i want to make a few points first this is the maximum that the clinton administration can do with available funds to support russian reform all of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the congress there is no need for the administration to go back to the congress to fund any of these programs all our fiscal year funds currently are available so in effect all of these programs can begin tomorrow the second point is that this package is designed to support russian reformers all of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the russian government third the president is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year the package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform in designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you fourth i d like to note the special importance of trade and investment i think it s fair to say that russia s capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars no collection of governments can meet those needs only the private sector can do so and so the president and president yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship they also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed headed on the u s side by vice president gore on the russian side by prime minister chernomyrdin and the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship if it would be helpful i d be prepared to run down the first page which is a summary of u s assistance and just give you some general background on what these programs are i ll do it quickly and then i ll be glad to take questions the first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance this is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the russian government can assure there s at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities that s million in grant that is from food for progress the grant portion of food for progress we ll also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies and that s million the second item is concessional food sales as you know the united states has had a long term grain relationship with russia it s important to us and it s important to russia that we continue that relationship the president has chosen the food for progress program which is a concessional loan program the value over the next seven months is million these are concessional terms the exact terms have not been worked out but i think it s fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal the third program is a collection of private sector support we think this is one of the most important things we re going to do privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in moscow and so the president has decided to create a russian american enterprise fund capitalized this year at million and the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in russia to take equity positions in those businesses the president has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state owned basis to a private basis he has also agreed the president has also agreed to establish a eurasia foundation this would be a private foundation led by prominent americans to fund democratization projects in russia the fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself i think it s fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in russia you see that we have a total of million in programs various programs the detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that we re launching the president is also calling for the development of a democracy corps which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the united states to support reform in russia the fifth program you see is russian office of resettlement this is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration this is a demonstration project what we d like to do is work with the russian military to help resettle russian officers returning from the baltic states and other parts of the former soviet union we want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that whether it s with russian labor and russian materials or using prefab american construction and so we ve decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of housing units we ll be working very closely with the russian military on this and i would say that we have a long term commitment to this project the sixth area is energy in the environment they are two issues that the president feels strongly about our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production both oil and gas and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems which cause so much environmental damage i ve talked a little bit about trade and investment about the new group being created that the vice president will chair on our side secretary ron brown will also be cochairing with deputy prime minister shohkin a business development committee which will work in all other sectors of the economy to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment we are also going to appoint a full time investment ombudsman in the american government to work on this problem full time and the point i d like to make here is trade and investment in the s is every bit as important to draw an analogy as arms reductions was in the s and s and we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it senior people on a full time basis because it is terribly important you ll notice that the united states is going to support russia s membership in the gatt russia has had observer status russia has requested our support and in fact requested our advice in becoming a member of the gatt we think that the long term goal of drawing russia into the global economy is paramount a very important goal and that is why we are supporting the membership in the gatt we are also supporting their access to gsp the generalized system of preferences you ll note that ex im has extended million in credit for a caterpillar deal in siberia that opic has extended million in credits and loan guarantees for a conoco oil project i d like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between russia and the united states for a billion framework facility through the ex im bank that would finance russian purchases of american oil and gas equipment and services we think this is a very important development we think we ll get there by april th which is the opening day of the tokyo conference the g conference before i take any further questions i d like to defer to my colleague who will review the security assistance objectives with you senior administration official our major unfinished agenda with the russians and with their counterparts in ukraine kazakhstan and belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the start i and start ii agreements recently we completed in moscow three i think very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of nunn lugar funding to three important programs the first is the program of million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program that is for submarines for icbm dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement million the second is a million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled this will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility and finally a million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system so we add that million total to the extant nunn lugar assistance which has been flowing about million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the russians over the last couple of years so this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the russians but with the ukrainians kazhaks and belarussians belarus for example has just in the last couple of weeks received up to million in fy funds for safety security and dismantlement programs on belarussian territory and this was in the wake of their ratification of start i an agreement to accede to npt so we are working very hard with all the parties to the lisbon protocols and will continue to work very hard with them and i look upon these three recent agreements with russia as a very important step in that process q the opic funds to is that for the field in kazhakstan and conoco already signed this deal with kazhakstan why do you feel now it is necessary if it s the same one why do you feel it s necessary senior administration official it s not the same deal chevron signed a deal with kazhakstan the tenges oil field this is a new investment project it s a polar lights oil development and renovation project and it s being announced today so it s completely new q can you tell us more about what s involved senior administration official yes conoco like other american oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things one to prospect for new oil in siberia west siberia and two to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines both oil and gas in russia the objective here obviously is to take advantage of the natural resources in russia increase energy production which will in turn increase hard currency revenues which is what russia needs so we think this deal is very very good development for russia the russians do as well and it s good for an american company and the american government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in opic and through the loan guarantee q so it s to search and also to renovate fields that are already there senior administration official that s right q on that point should other american companies expect to get administration support for such deals or should they now go to the ex im and try to get the money out of the billion senior administration official well as you know ex im is part of the u s government and various parts of the u s government have been pushing including the state department and the white house for this deal to be consummated and we think it will and if we arrive at this agreement by april th there will be billion in financing available for american companies to sell their equipment and sell their services q that should take up all of the rest of the deals and their won t be and their will or there won t be support for opic sort of deals such as this conoco senior administration official there s a tremendous amount of interest on the part of american oil and gas companies to invest in russia we think that the ex im oil and gas facility the billion facility once it is concluded will soak up a lot of that interest but i think the interest may even extend beyond that and if so the government will respond q what s the current year budget costs of that billion agreement should it go forward and is there any current year budget costs senior administration official i ll have to refer you to ex im for that i don t know the details of that q the concessional food sales is there any current year costs to that or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due senior administration official the concessional food sales are from food for progress which is a usda program usda has the funds we don t need to go back to the congress to expend those funds there will be a hit in the budget i d refer you to usda and omb for the details on that q can you talk about the democracy corps q and the private sector how many folks are going to be involved in that senior administration official why don t i start with the democracy corps first i think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization private organizations in the united states that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in russia helping on a farmer to farmer basis and there were literally or u s government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area and so the administration felt the president felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts and so this is a presidential initiative it will be headed by ambassador tom simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for u s assistance in the former soviet union and we re very hopeful that we might use this democracy corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government but the resources of the american private sector and schools and communities across the nation q any kind of commitment yet any kind of word yet on fy and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the million the president talked about senior administration official the administration is requesting additional funds in fy of million what the president has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with president yeltsin about additional measures the united states could take in some of these areas to support reform he ll be consulting with the congress when he returns to washington he ll be consulting also with the other ally governments and we ll make a decision at that time q two questions about the billion agricultural money first of all i thought it was the sort of consensus that what russia did not need was more loans for food so why did you decide to do it that way secondly could you explain agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of russia s inability to pay how does this fit into that situation senior administration official as you know the united states for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities agricultural products to russia i think between and we had extended a little bit of history here about billion in credits credit guarantees through the commodity credit corporation that was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of american grain products on december of last year the russian government stopped its payments on that program they are now in arrears to us on that program and therefore by law the united states cannot continue that program and so the president working with secretary espy and other officials in the cabinet looked for other ways that we could promote american grain sales and i think we have two ways to do that we ve announced today million in grant food assistance through the food for progress program but we do not have sufficient authority to spend million in grant food and so we looked for a concessional loan program i think everybody agrees that russia that a short term loan program for russia would not make sense now but a long term concessional loan program would and that is what this program is it will provide once the final details are worked out for a six to seven year grace period on payments of principal and then from years seven through which is the life of the deal it will provide for concessional rates of interest generally around three to four percent and so we believe and the russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years but it will also continue this very important grain relationship which is important for them and it s important for the american farm community q i gather from what you say that this could make it explicit the russians failure to pay the interest on ecc loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through is that right senior administration official let me be explicit about that we are prevented under the law to from continuing the commodity credit corporation short term credit program because of russia s arrearages to the united states all of you know about those arrearages they total about i think around million usda can give you an exact figure so having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve american market share and a long term grain relationship wanting to respond to a specific request from the russian government for major food assistance knowing that we couldn t take it from the grant programs because we don t have sufficient authority there we looked at food for progress which is a program we ve used to great effect in other parts of the world and we consulted with the russian government and arrived at this solution i think the russians are pleased because it provides them with the food but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short term payments q where do those funds actually come from senior administration official they come from the food for progress program which is a program under usda s authority usda has the authority to spend these funds we do not need to go back to the congress for these funds and i want to make that general point again everything in this package the billion package comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the congress the administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow and it s very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year that we meet these commitments and we are confident we ll be able to do so q how did you arrive at the figure of million does that max out that program or did you actually have a range from to senior administration official there s a reason for it the reason was that the russian government told us that s about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time and so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn at which time russia won t require the same level of food imports from the west q i would imagine there s going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with russia have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the ukraine with georgia with some of the other republics senior administration official yes we re very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending american support to the other countries of the former soviet union we have told ourselves and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance the grant technical assistance that you see roughly percent of the funding will go to russia and roughly percent to the other countries in the area of food sales we have been active with ukraine in grant food assistance with georgia and armenia we will continue that and i think it s fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and they re hard hitting q has anything happened at the summit to lead american energy companies and other companies to believe that russia is going to be more user friendly toward them in terms of taxing legalities bureaucracy senior administration official well one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight not only the economic agenda but also trade and investment and i d like to refer to the point i made at the beginning we re convinced in talking about this problem the problem of how to support russia long term we re convinced that no collection of western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform that only the private sector can do that we look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector it is a very good match with what the russians need now which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production that s what the russian government has told us it wants to do and so that s why we have made such a major emphasis on it that s why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks and in fact figured prominently last night in the meeting between president yeltsin and president clinton and we re hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the american business community that we support their efforts to invest in russia that the united states through ex im and opec and the department of commerce will be there to support them q my question is is yeltsin in any position to deliver on making russia a more senior administration official we think he is i would note that president yeltsin s prime minister mr chernomyrdin worked for years in the russian oil and gas sector he will now chair a high level commission with the vice president vice president gore to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to western investment in the oil and gas sector we believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee and we re looking forward to the work q what type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program and will the u s be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the russian government for distribution at their will senior administration official are you talking about the variety of programs listed here it depends on the program itself in most cases though we are either working through american pbos or american government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent that the money gets to the intended source that s an obligation we have to the congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money we have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs but they are all quite different for instance in the area of grant food and medical assistance for grant food it is carried out through usda and usda accounts for the delivery of the food for grant medical assistance we ve been working through project hope which is a private organization for the housing for instance the resettlement of russian officers we ll be working with a group of american pbos on some of the democratization projects we re working directly with russian private individuals and private foundations we re working with journalists in russia on a media project that you may have noticed so we literally have here to different activities under all these rubrics and they re all going to be carried out in slightly different ways some directly with the russian government some with russian citizens q the jackson vanik restrictions that remain and on the cocom restrictions that remain can you tell us what the president has to do on that senior administration official well as george noted yesterday president yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship the president has noted that i think it s fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to washington and look at both of these questions and we ll get back to the russian government q you were not prepared for these questions when you got here senior administration official we were prepared for these questions we ve looked at them but we re not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend they require let me just explain particularly on jackson vanik they require consultation with the congress they require consultation with the american jewish community and we re very sensitive to those concerns and so we ll want to go back and talk to them before we take any action q is this package designed so that you will not have to go to congress for anything at this point senior administration official as i said at the beginning the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the congress so the administration will not have to go back to the congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts in effect they can all begin tomorrow and i know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow and that s the advantage of this particular initiative q if this as the president says is a long term long haul thing and members of congress are at this moment heading for moscow why aren t you talking about going to congress and suggesting to the president of russia that you are prepared to go to congress for various things senior administration official i think we ve been clear about that the president is discussing this weekend with president yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for american funding of additional projects and ideas that he has we have a major congressional delegation that left last night headed by representative gephardt and we ll want to consult with that delegation and other members of congress before doing anything and we ll also want to consult with our allies so that s where it stands now q we ve been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be senior administration official i think that we ve said that these are all projects that either congress had allocated money for through the freedom support act there were some funds that were left over from fy and this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended we didn t use just the freedom support act funds or the fy funds we went into some of the agency allocations ex im opic and usda and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs and example of that is the food for progress concessional loans we had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through usda we could not go forward legally and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued american market share and ensure continued grain sales and we think we found it q where for example are you getting the money for this russian officer resettlement senior administration official that s from the freedom support act funds q in other words all of the money is being directly spent in new ways so to speak senior administration official most of the grant projects that you see if you look at the general chart the second chart it s broken down into grant and credits and if you look under grants the technical cooperation projects that total million that is almost all freedom support act funding a little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year the nunn lugar funds of course you know about the legislative history of those funds q cooperation senior administration official from fy i don t have the exact figure it was not a considerable figure q could you tell us please has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between ukraine and russia over start for start i and ii as a result of what s happened here senior administration official both presidents president yeltsin and president clinton will be discussing this issue this morning in fact we haven t yet gotten to security and arms control related issues that will be this morning s session i know that president clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us we ve been talking to the russians and the ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them up to this point this has been a very important negotiation that s been going on essentially between moscow and kiev and we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion help to move things forward essentially but in terms of what is coming out of this weekend i don t yet know in a couple hours we ll know q just a follow up on the financing here is any of this robbing peter to pay boris since it s all current year appropriations have you taken it from anyplace that s been earmarked and put it into this fund senior administration official there are smoke and mirrors here and i think it s an important point to note we could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out year funding we re going to make a long term commitment to many of these projects for instance the enterprise funds the privatization effort the housing effort and we ve already talked to the russians about our long term commitment we could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package but we wanted to make a point this package is fy it s funds that we have and we re going to do what we say we re going to do and the president feels very strongly about that in the past there is a legacy that the western governments the combination of governments put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we re not able to meet them we re determined and the president is determined to carry out every single program in this package and we ll do it but we do have a longer term commitment and that s part of the discussions on economics this weekend we re looking for russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform and we ve told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year q taken it way from any senior administration official no we haven t okay the question is have we reprogrammed any of these funds so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in russia the answer is no we have not done so q in terms of funding there is no available monies left and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else doesn t that in fact support the theory senior administration official not at all i don t think it does that s a particular example and the example is grain sales the commodity credit corporation credit guarantee program was short term loans that russia had to pay back within to months you all know about russia s debt problem and russia was unable to meet those commitments so we looked for a way to do two things to meet russia s requirement for grain they re a net grain importer on a massive scale and also meet our objective of making sure that the american farmers have a chance to sell their products to russia and we simply look for another way to finance that and we have legislative authority to do it this program has been successful in other areas we had not tried it before in the former soviet union but we thought we should now q isn t this really the bush clinton aid package for russia since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by president bush senior administration official no i don t think that s a fair characterization a lot of these funds were appropriated by the u s congress is in this administration took office and inherited some obligations that the bush administration had made but we had a long six to seven week review of this program we decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration but we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund which was just an idea but the idea had not been filled out with a program there was no number attached to it in grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort i would say is another clinton initiative further we listened to the russian government and listened to the russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons and president clinton has responded to that and we are making a long term commitment that beyond this demonstration project we re going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers i would also say that the president has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the russian experience and in calling for the creation of a democracy corps which is another new initiative we re hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the american government to achieve that objective so i would not characterize it that way at all and as most of you know i am a career civil servant i was in the last administration i m very familiar with what the last administration did and i would characterize this as a clinton assistance package for russia q there s been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because it s being administered by the russian government senior administration official i think that i know that the president and other senior officials of our government are concerned that american money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that it s intended for which it s intended and so we re going to take great care aid and the state department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that they re reaching their source i would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the russian government some of these projects especially in democratization and exchanges are going to be worked out directly with russian private individuals with businesses the private enterprise support is another example of that senior administration official if i could just add a word on this point with regard to the ssd related programs one area that we ve been looking at very very closely is consideration of actually using russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs they would be working very closely of course with the american firms who would be the prime contractors but this is a fine example i think of a more of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level down to the ground in russia but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended q when would the democracy corps start exactly when do you see this happening how would get it off the ground senior administration official well the president is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps i think it s fair to say that we re going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks ambassador simons takes up his duties on may st but in effect we ve already started because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in russia and we ve said that we will be helpful we ve also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government we do have or agencies that are active in russia in one way or another we think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts q excuse me how much of this billion will actually be spent in the united states by american made goods senior administration official i don t have any figures for you now but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that q this figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions or have we just been that far off the mark senior administration official no i think unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark and i m sorry to say that no this package president clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package and he was briefed intensively on this he contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package he contributed a lot of the ideas in the package and i think it s fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago we have been refining it ever since we spent a couple of days last week going over it with the russian government both the embassy in washington and the government in moscow through our own embassy and so it s been evolving but this particular package has been together for about two weeks q where is yeltsin s input into this then there was so much talk before about the president wanted to get yeltsin s views about specifically what was needed and so forth is that in the out years senior administration official no it s both president yeltsin has on several occasions told us for instance that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him that the resettlement of russian military officers is important and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them and so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package we listened to him on the privatization effort we have been working with the russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details so the russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way but let me get at the other part of your question the president is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake and we re looking for his ideas the president has brought his own ideas to the table for instance on energy and the environment and in housing but we re looking for russian ideas not we need to consult with the congress and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active q there s essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with senior administration official this particular package as i said was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago we have since then consulted with the russian government on the final stages of its development and so this weekend we ve primarily talked about future about what more the united states and other western countries can do to support reform in russia which is our base objective here q i noticed that you that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization senior administration official you re right we have a program to train russian young russians in banking and financial services in the united states part of the housing initiative it s not just to build housing units it s to retrain russian officers who are retiring into other professions q money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization senior administration official we have not yet allocated any money for that q why not q of the million is going to build housing units isn t that a lot of money per unit given what the western dollar will buy in the former soviet union senior administration official if you want to do housing the right way it s not just the building the framework of a house you ve got to think about all the utilities you ve got to think about the purchase of land you ve got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth and it s also retraining it s not enough to put retired an officer coming out of riga or tallin or vilnius in a house in western russia we think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well this is responding to a request from the russian government q of the million will go to retrain senior administration official that s right q are you talking about apartment buildings or single senior administration official we re talking about single individual dwellings q you re saying that only families will be served by this senior administration official what i want to i thought i pointed out earlier this is a demonstration project what we didn t want to do given the experience that the germans and the turks and the italians have had in building housing in western russian we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money what we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with american organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done i noted that we have a long term commitment to that and so i would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future but we want to do it wisely we want to spend the money wisely q what is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect russia s reforms and that russia will be in a position to may back the money they re supposed to pay back especially considering their other debt problem senior administration official well look i think it s important to note that the united states on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of russian reform it s got to be a collective western effort and we re looking to our allies to do more as well but beyond that it s really what the russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform we can simply play a role and we feel we have an obligation to do so which is consistent with our national interests q did the president say that the value of the u s contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the united states so what is it about this program that does this senior administration official i think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward russia and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform we are convinced that if reformers stay in power then we ll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction which are the three benefits to the united states from reform in russia so it s not a simple question you can t just say that this program is the answer it s a long term question and we have to make a long term commitment to it q and then on the question of russia s ability to repay what convinces you they ll be able to pay seven to years from now senior administration official well the russian government has made a commitment to repay and what we re hoping is that if reform continues and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues that russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans q substantial government to government loan we ve ever gotten into with the russians senior administration official i don t want to answer authoritatively on that i don t go back or years on this but in the last four or five years yes it is because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans this is a different type of effort q government loans in any other sector that you recall i know it wasn t done in senior administration official i think it s fair to say this is a new and unique effort end a m pdt\n", "label": "politics"}, {"text": "re supply side economic policy was re david stockman in article ufk gqu

them nordic so the use of the word by westerners though meant with apparent good humor in this case is nontheless inappropriate the only westerners who may have some claim to call themselves aryans by

skewed toward poorer people in fact most anti gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal protection they make it an offense to damage people based on a motivation of hatred for sexual orientation

the question as put a parallel q is a person of color a human being a you ll have to define what you mean by human being to answer your irrelevant question yes a person of color is human but i still don t know what you mean by human being and you have merely begged the question without responding by trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever the same parallel question could be is a polydactyl person a human being you still have not answered what you mean by human being please do so i would suggest that legal precedent defines a human being i e a person whose rights are protected by the constitution and the law as someone with a functioning brain could you cite some of those precedents for me or the basis of this definition while the law does allow the removal of extraordinary means of sustaining life in cases of brain death this in itself does not lead to your conclusion of how the law defines a human being however at least you defined human being in a tenuous fashion that is a person whose rights are protected by the constitution and the law for my answer to your question i refer you to roe v wade and subsequent supreme court decisions which define to what extent a fetus is protected by the constitution and the law certain judges have concurred that slavery is not a violation of human rights therefore it is not you won t answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies if you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law but holds solid whatever the law may rule provide it for me i would suggest that your blind faith would not likely hold up if the shoe were on the other foot the brain life death paradigm is one that i suggest as one consistent with other legal definitions it clearly doesn t matter to you whether an unborn child has any rights or not however so the point is lost on you more irrelevancies as larry margolis pointed out the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses but does not follow your version of human being and as he pointed out brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living but rather who has died there is a significant difference what i am wondering now is has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started you got answers to your questions when you began baiting me if you recall after you had made some ridiculous remarks about adrienne regard and having been corrected changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance if you really wanted a discussion of substance why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations e g it really doesn t matter to you if it matters to you then why not define human being and seek some substance you re not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words if she is then why does the mother have the right to kill her when she is in the womb but not after she has passed through the birth canal because a woman has a right to have any object which threatens her health and is within the confines of her body removed the other side of the argument would give rights to the fetus that would not be granted to an adult human if for example you were occupying the body of another for whatever reason or through whatever means the reason and means being irrelevant that other would be able to remove or have you removed if that removal required your demise i see no reason in law that such a removal could not be effected rather than examining a hypothetical thought experiment let us examine a real though rare situation siamese twins if one siamese twin has the other surgically removed knowing that it will cause death and barring some emergency where they will both die anyway it is murder is it have you any support for this assertion furthermore your analogy is completely inapplicable siamese twins have an equal claim to any body parts they have in common try again what establishes this equal claim beyond your assertion if it is merely a matter of which came first cannot one kill the other since they both have equal claim what if one has more motor control than the other does that establish a superior claim as others point out one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival again your analogy fails not precedence but possession makes a difference here a woman s womb is indisputably her own also i see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being was that due to its inconvenience you see the right to life is granted to adult humans in the same sense as it should be to the foetus at some point prior to birth are siamese twins ever separated in the womb or is this right you assert for siamese twins which i don t even think is true as stated or valid as an analogy one that exists after birth freivald your entire argument here is a failure interesting way of trying to combine two essentially orthogonal concepts the point is that it is murder for one siamese twin to kill the other regardless of their status of physiological dependence or interdependence is it please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling it would be difficult for one siamese twin to kill the other inside the womb and even if it were possible i doubt that a case could be made for premeditation or neglegence note the use of the phrase it should be in my post you simply assert things without any support your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported try this on for size it is not murder for one siamese twin to kill the other in the womb there we now have equal arguments but the idea is illogical for one siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well the systems are dependent on each other for life i m still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so of course the situation is not a perfect comparison it may well be that one siamese twin deliberately initiates oppression or coersion against the other this is clearly not the case with an unborn child and this last statement from you is a total non sequitur the comparison is far worse than you give it credit for are you going to let this assertion stand on its own also or do you plan on following up with a reasoned argument your argument is from fantasy island your comparison is a total failure as i have demonstrated already and has no basis in reality neither legally nor medically and for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible that of coercion or oppression is ridiculous as i said you give the analogy too little credit for failure on the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real rather than a hypothetical situation then you fly off into siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version as i said before decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive and furthermore as i have already said there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal you seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman s womb when the fetus is born what happens to its claim and by what reason do you assert its claim if a parent has the right to choose to not take responsibility for their own child why are there laws and penalties against child abandonment this last question is irrelevant and something of a non sequitur can you establish some relevance or even some sense for it if at some point an unborn child is a human being the parents clearly have the same responsibilities toward her as any other parents have toward their children again what is the relevance you have established no sense of when that point is you ignore the significant difference between a fetus and a born child the dependence of a born child can be transferred to another party while that of a fetus cannot a born child does not live within the body of another human being while a fetus does thereby representing potential and often actual harm to that body as in the case of one of our talk abortion participants who suffers from epilepsy and to whom pregnancy represents a significant health risk or as in the case of a woman i know who chose to continue her pregnancy but spent her entire pregnancy confined to a wheelchair and suffering great pain from constriction of some nerve and your argument is not an argument against abortion generally but at best an argument against abortion at some time during the course of pregnancy again a quest for common ground most of the pro choice people i have spoken to in person none of them pro abortion activists concede that the child has a right to life at some point that supersedes all of the mother s rights except that of her own life as is often the case in emotionally charged issues the activists have a very different outlook from the mainstream you haven t answered the question the situations are not analagous the dependence of a born child is not transferred instantaneously it takes time and effort incidentally it is the pro choice side not me arguing that the government should make it easy for parents to abandon their children to the state again you avoid the question dependence can be transferred and it is not as slow as you seem to think as to the anecdotal evidence of real human tragedy there is ample on both sides i would hate to be in the position of the mother in nyc who has to tell her daughter that she lost her arm in a botched abortion attempt yes and i d hate to have been the one to tell dr gunn s children that he was murdered by a religious pro life fanatic please do try to stay relevant the kindest thing i can say about these responses of yours is that i can see you are trying to say

what happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not by your standards what is different about the two situations i see i have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you in the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake you can t have it both ways action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle but you are wrong about the inaction anyway ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was to have a healthy live child a woman does more than hang out eat as she chooses plays volleyball like she always did drinks at parties with her friends etc she behaves very differently

from scratch what i finally decided was that the law should not recognize such classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare some people to be of more worth than others and that would be anathema to the underlying american concept of equal treatment under the law last year when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty plus crimes including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not protected by that aura of deterrence critics pointed out the absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a civilian teacher when the latter arguably provided a much more valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society this was an emotionally compelling argument but even the proponents of that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their contribution to society i view that doctrine as being both a personally repugnant and b repugnant to the equal protection clause of the th amendment accordingly i

were not what the desired picture was not enough simply ignoring me if i am such a kook was not enough even now i do not wish to have him axed but i do wish to express my disgust about this argumentum ad silence your opponent um i would have thought he would have wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and seem sooo wise to himself i think the issue that seems to be is the following an advertisement apparently ted and mark think so i posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken off the net from last year if reposting an article constitutes posting an ad then i am guilty this post did have a name and address and yes a price if one had posted the address and subscription price of newsweek would that be an ad i get nothing from showing this stuff i posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of proof that was requested by ted frank he then complains to my sysadmin saying that i am advertising and lo and behold poof there goes my

you send a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin they rarely get ya know that user on your net was real helpful or whatever they only get i don t like what that user is doing because please do not send the note to the sysadmin i need to take it to them in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through in my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying thanks for the info or could you send me such and such or your posts are very interesting keep it up and only a handfull of go aways but i guess the fact that i have decided not to waste my time trying to

from the tax collector saying that a lien was removed due to a letter that i wrote challenging jurisdiction oh well it takes time to come up with the info requested and i was just getting started it should be noted that ted frank has been accused publicly over times of being an nwo supporter and has never made an statements to the contrary further what are ted frank s motivations for getting me axed we all know that some people are getting paid to collect info on people on the net that are of interest to the government and ted sure seems to have a personal interest in debunking me hmmm just

you meant to imply that or not but i just thought i d bring that up hitler became chancellor because people voted for his political party that s not a huge difference in a parliamentary system your statement is a common misconception but it just isn t true in the german weimar system the chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the largest reichstag party the chancellor was appointed by the president and generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective majority in the reichstag beyond that the implication that hitler rose to the chancellorship because a majority of germans wanted nazi rule is false as well before president hindenburg appointed hitler chancellor in january the german people did not show a particular desire to be led either by hitler or by the nazi party these are the results of the march election for president the closest hitler ever came to direct election hindenburg hitler thaelmann duesterberg in the runoff election in april the results were hindenburg hitler thaelmann so we can see that hitler personally was supported by only about a third of german voters similarly the nazi party never received more than of the vote in reichstag elections that occurred in july in the november election the nazis lost two million votes and seats down from to out of the in the reichstag comparitively the socialists had and the communists the communists had gained seats and the german national party which had supported the previous government had picked up a million of the nazis lost votes to gain seats up to i think the other large party was the catholic center party i don t know how many seats they had but i think they were declining and there were numerous other small parties thus the nazi vote was on the decline at the time hitler was appointed chancellor what brought hitler to power was not the demand of the german people for hitler or the nazis to run things but the inability of the other parties to put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government for the country germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition and their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the interests of the majority of the population instead what they had was a number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific objectives in order to combine against the nazis who were out to end the democratic process in fact part of the problem was that some of the other parties with substantial representation like the communists were also out to end the democratic process but with different results in mind and generally didn t mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under germany had already had a non nazi chancellor with a majority coalition for five months while the nazis had been the largest reichstag party and there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the nazis if anything the nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed to get enough support to make hitler president and their popular vote had begun to decline hitler was not hindenburg s first choice to be chancellor not even his second choice first von papen had been chancellor since june after the november election when the nazis lost seats hindenburg first prevailed on von papen to remain as chancellor but there were intrigues behind his back and support for him was lacking so then hindenburg turned to von schleicher who became chancellor for two months eventually he too was unable to hold together a working coalition of parties to oppose the nazis who refused to participate in any government that was not led by a nazi chancellor some of the nazi leadership particularly gregor strasser who was the man in the party at the time wanted to participate in a coalition government but others knowing the party s support was waning figured that their best hope to gain power lay in undermining the democratic process nevertheless the country was governed for seven months by chancellors who were not nazis even though the nazis were the largest reichstag party the failure of these men to achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition parties to work together here s how william shirer puts it in the rise and fall of the third reich the cardinal error of the germans who opposed nazism was their failure to unite against it at the crest of their popular strength in july the national socialists had attained but percent of the vote but the percent of the german people who expressed their opposition to hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm them unless they united however temporarily to stamp it out true the german people supported hitler after he became chancellor but that doesn t change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him before he was in power the german people were not crying out for hitler to take over no matter how bad economic conditions were the leftist parties socialists communists probably had more support in total than the nazis hitler used the fact that others were passively or

potential project from the same agency but it is clear that the effort was to make clinton s potential expenditures appear to be linked to projects with absurd names not to be taken seriously any more than equivalent tactics by democrats would have been in the reagan bush era the fact is that primetime tm of abc has had numberous reposts on such waste programs that already exist again if we are

"re top ten reasons not to aid russians in article c qr duu encore com rcollins encore com roger collins writes julie eddie jpl nasa gov julie kangas writes i suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti west slogans coming from his opponents in the russian congress i sure know who i want to back could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a gun if we had backed him strongly early on i doubt there would be the problem there is now many russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt rightly imo that the west didn t care yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid once bush got over his gorby mania this probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections well the aid didn t come through and we didn t make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding have you considered a non interventionist policy if market reform does happen russia will certainly get private capital at private risk to help their economy they will even have incentive to do so for the same reason if they don t reform then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them if they don t reform i don t believe in giving them money however i think this is too important to take a non interventionist approach this is what really bugs me about libertarianism it sounds like it ll all be the same in a hundred years time no need to do anything how does this affect us well we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of europe are blown away i think we d feel something a massive breakup of a country that spans th the planet is bound to have affects here of course there is also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies or struggling democracies if a billion gift was that important to our well being couldn t it be raised voluntarilly people already give over billion a year to charity despite the wishes of libertarians this society is a far way and getting farther from being libertarian perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it we have to face the problem now not in x years when we have a libertarian dream society right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade let alone charity there are still limitations to high tech exports nasa can t buy proton launch vehicles from them sure the market may be able to help a great deal but it can t right now there are too many obstacles instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face seriously everyone has different opinions on what is stupid my two causes are aid to russia and a strong space program someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish that is why we have a republic and not a true democracy instead of gridlock on a massive scale we only have gridlock on a congressional scale it seems instead of gridlock on any scale we have aid to russia expensive space programs national charity that doesn t help the poor and probably studies of drunken goldfish i think limited government is more key than how democratic it is well i think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited but the main question is how do you transform a state run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours btw sometimes it seems that our government is trying to go the opposite direction it is not going to be painless and not going to be easy we simply cannot wait to help when they have the proper government they ll never get there without the aid it may be too late already btw who is to decide stupid this is just like those who want to impose their morals on others just the sort of thing i thought libertarians were against that was an opinion and libertarians are very big on free speech and i m just excercising mine actually my politics are pretty libertarian except on this one issue and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party it seems that libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim if you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should be very libertarian consider it a compromise how much money would your fellow russia aiders have to give to russia if those you oppose weren t using the same government machine to steal money from you and your group for causes you don t support as i also said above another problem i have is with transformation a libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight i have seen nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self sufficient populace we could do that years ago but not now people have been saying that for hundreds of years they didn t have nuclear weapons years ago nor instantaneous communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in less than a day like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and global decision making all the more reason to depend on the free market which can more efficiently process information than to depend on rulers for decisions on complex issues yes depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses rulers do emerge somewhere and they will never represent the opinions of every person on the planet there must be checks and balances checks on the government when it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of bounds putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market is to me just like putting

straight bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody fuck out of him they would get charged as well under all the federal laws that exist about violation of civils rights the focus of their intent is his sexual orientation and so the law applies to them as well the national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone s civil rights until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it the fact is that at last count gays were not beating straights for their sexual

government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights it s the way they broke the back of the klan by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically it is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over years ago it has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority it is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the civil war people who harrassed free blacks when normally they wouldn t find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for to years until nobody wanted to try it anymore now with the th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody they

welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of april you know today is april th in thomas jefferson was born years ago i think that s appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been of course a person who has been one that we ve all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country the success of our democracy according to jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system his philosophy of government his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening tonight we re so pleased to have with us president clinton he s come over from the white house to join us in the chamber of commerce studios mr president it s good to have you we thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening also we have with us secretary of labor robert reich and bob it s certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also i have some questions for our two guests and i m sure many of you do too so please call us if there s something that you d like to ask the number is or in washington d c the number is or i believe the president has a few words that he might want

reich also members of my cabinet at the headquarters of the chamber of commerce to support the effort that the chamber is making along with its center for work force preparation to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place i want to compliment the chamber on all their efforts recognizing that without an educated work force we can t grow this economy or remain competitive and recognizing that we all have to work together business and government labor and educators to make things happen this satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together and if you ll forgive me a little home state pride i want to say a special word of thanks to the wal mart corporation headquartered in bentonville arkansas for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight i appreciate that a lot as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you i have tried as hard as i could to move toward constructive change for this country secretary riley talked about this being thomas jefferson s th birthday if thomas jefferson believed in anything he believed in these three things first in education second in real personal liberty freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of association freedom of the press and third in the absolute imperative of changing as times change if you go to the jefferson memorial here in this beautiful city which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms you will see jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times for us here in america that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world we re here to talk about that tonight about what we can do to educate and train our people better unless we do that none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government even to bring the budget into balance even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs will last in the long run we also have to have people who can carry their load and in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime it s not just important what you know but what you can learn and if i might i d like to close just by emphasizing we re doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the labor department and the education department and the private sector to build a good school to work transition and we re trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than new summer jobs including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time dick i think i ought to stop there that s a good place we can begin i think the discussion secretary riley thank you so much mr president each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals and tonight we ll focus on goal five and how

challenge a program of work and learning to america s youth the aim is to use some special funds from president clinton s proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country mr president let s talk a minute you alluded to it somewhat about the summer youth challenge your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs and why in your words is that so important the president i think it s important for two reasons first of all a lot of the young people we re trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning and while we want them to have a good experience with a real job we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime and that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before secondly we want to help these young people progress not only in terms of work but in terms of learning we want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners and we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school or at work or in college as they go on secretary riley well i think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids that gap that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year is really even greater secretary reich of course you have training programs throughout the year and i wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training secretary reich well what we ve learned mr secretary is that for many young people whether it s for the summer or for the year actually on the job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning many young people for example have a lot they have a difficult time learning geometry but when they actually are there building something or working on something and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry they understand what it s used for and a lot of young people just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly terribly important it s important during the summer but it s important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer secretary riley thank you mr president you ve called for a youth apprenticeship program school to work transition and i wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing the president well first of all let s talk about why it s important most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four year college degree but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma if you look at the last years the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade the young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade because they weren t productive they weren t more valuable to their employers so we think america has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but don t go on to college make a transition to work which includes two years of further training either in a community college a vocational setting or perhaps on the job and what i have done in this budget as you know is to give you and secretary reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state by state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community based on the needs of the economy in any given area it could revolutionize long term the quality of the american work force and the earnings of american workers secretary reich i should add mr president i think you know this from your experience in arkansas and many of the people watching this program that the business community and educators labor groups are already in many of our communities many of our states building a school to work transition program in fact there s an awful lot of ferment a lot of excitement the people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that and more power to them secretary riley and i are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there secretary riley bob we re going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep the co op learning career academies and what features all those programs that deal with this subject what are some of the features that every one of these school to work programs might have that are important secretary reich well one thing that we ve seen and you and i have been working at this for a long time and you much longer than i we ve seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential and i m so delighted that we re doing this in the headquarters of the chamber of commerce the chamber of commerce of the united states is committed to doing these kinds of programs training education retraining and we ve aimed to work very closely with the chamber the business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators community colleges technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future communities have got to come together i mean this is one of the most important things you ve got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together you know too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here labor groups over here and everybody is talking but they re not really working together in a common strategy and the third and final ingredient i would say dick would be a commitment to excellence a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence this is not a tracking program we re talking about for kids who are not going to make it this is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for if they want to go on beyond that to four year college that s fine that ought to be permissible but we re talking about the foundation of learning about jobs the foundation skills for on the job learning and again those are the critical components it s already being done the president i think if i might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home the business community has a critical role to play not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here s what ought to be taught but also in monitoring that excellence if you have the right sort of partnership there the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them so i think that s very important and when we try to if you will fill in the blanks at the federal level trying to set some standards and provide some funds one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs because that s really what s going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile secretary riley that s great we ve been talking of course about school to work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall but let s talk just a moment about long term school reform it s something especially close to me mr president i wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on goals legislation that i think will be coming forth before too long the president well as you know back when you and i were both governors we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize i had a hand in writing the national education goals that the governors drafted along with representatives of president bush s administration back in and what we re going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners too meet those goals making sure that when by people show up for school ready to learn that we get a percent on time high school graduation rate that children at the th th and th grades are confident in the subjects they re supposed to know that they are second to none in math and science that are schools are safe disciplined and drug free and of course the fifth goal i took them out of line to say this the last is that we have a system of life long learning in this country and each one of those goals there s a national role a state role a school role school district role and a private sector role and what you ve attempted to do in this bill you re going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is and then to give the rest of america a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we re actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet it s very exciting so far as i know nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job i m really excited about it secretary riley well i am too and i think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts all driven by high standards that s the point bob let me ask you one question and then we ll get to the telephone calls it s about the same subject we have of course skills standards that are going to be part of goals and i wonder if you would comment on that secretary reich well you know we have percent of our young people who don t graduate from college very often they don t have very many alternatives they do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs everybody doesn t have to go to college other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical preprofessional skills we can do it in this country if you don t go to four year college you re not a loser and we want to develop those national skill standards we re going to be working with the states with the education department with a lot of private industry in developing those standards and i think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around as well as our business community secretary riley well that s great why don t we go ahead and go to the telephone we have a call i see mayor bruce todd of austin texas q yes mr president and mr secretary reich and riley we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today we have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative let me simply say amen to some of the comments made already we agree with much of the tone that the clinton administration has taken and are very supportive we have been successful here in austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years we expect to have over employed this year in the summertime perhaps as much as with the federal assistance much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments so we must be thinking alike but the question essentially involved what initiatives after labor day would be appropriate we know summertime is important year round is even more important and what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year round basis and perhaps more importantly how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative that s something that we believe is very important to success in this effort secretary riley mr president the president i think i ll give everybody a chance to answer the question bruce but let me first thank you for calling and thank you for all the great work that you re doing in austin i ve seen some of it and i ve always been very impressed first with regard to the summer program we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector too we hope that secretary reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer and we re working on that secondly in the program that i have presented to the congress over the next five years what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that s quite substantial for job training programs for school to work programs all of which give heavy heavy weight to local community input just the question you asked but do provide some federal investment dollars which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year round basis and i will say again to echo what secretary reich said a moment ago to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning an awful lot of young people actually have quite high iqs but actually learn so much better when they re doing than when they re reading or just listening so we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent and we hope that if the whole budget passes and we do have budget cuts and more than actually in the budget and some revenue raisers and some new money for education and training that we ll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question bob do you want to say anything secretary reich well you took most of the words out of my mouth mr president as usual but let me just add one thing and that is that one of the most important aspects of post high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college in addition to the school to work program simply is the availability of jobs and we ve got to get this economy moving again obviously it s terribly important to get this recovery program to get the economy back on track that s sort of the prerequisite to everything else if we don t get the economy back on track we have i think this is the th correct me if i m wrong mr president i think is the th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater this is a jobless recovery a lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in june and even if we did everything right they would have a very very hard time getting jobs secretary riley thank you both of course goals will be a permanent long term thing that will certainly reach into next year it will involve if passed and we certainly hope it will be action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways and then the state with all the various school districts a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement and i think everybody will see a great energy out there once we get that moving the next call is dr harry heinemann new york doctor q good evening mr secretary it is a pleasure to be on with you this evening as you may know bridging the school and work has been central to la guardia s educational program since its inception in the s and that includes the college the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus and the linkages we have forged with the local schools we have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy and over the years we ve come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work and these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace with providing all students early exposure to careers as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills and lastly the critical role of the liberal arts particularly in the development of high performance competencies my question then is how can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience and what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration secretary riley well thank you very much i think and we ll get a response from you all on that and very interesting work going on there we re going to have three people our next guests on the program this evening that will be some specialists in that area that you re speaking and i ll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later you all care to comment any comments you might have the president i d just like to say if i might one thing i want to reemphasize this and i don t think i m being as clear about it as i d like although i think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than i i think this whole concept of applied academics is very important and i think that we have to basically abolish what i consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning i think we should keep the liberal arts going i think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program secretary reich it seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students they re important for all students it s not just a special group of students that needs them some of the experiments that i ve seen around the united states dick i m sure you ve seen them as well are mainstream experiments they re mainstreaming all the students at th and th grades they re giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program and again the kids can either go on to college if they want they can go on to technical community they can go on to an entirely a large variety of possibilities and career directions but we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job related or work related work within the classroom within our schools secretary riley thank you very much i think that s going to be the last call that we have time for mr president i think you ve got to move on to another matter and i want to thank you and secretary reich for being here we appreciate your time and your ideas and it s been a tremendous help to us end p m edt\n", "label": "politics"}, {"text": "re clinton president s remarks at town hall meeting in a previous article clinton hq campaign org clinton gore says the

this round in article apr midway uchicago edu thf midway uchicago edu said uh no that s not what happened in boomer what happened in boomer was that the judge didn t allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi million dollar plant to be shut down over in damages and required the plant to pay the plaintiffs the to make them whole the plant would never have been shut down the plaintiff s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than k to having the plant shut down while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation everyone s property rights were protected the plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were avoided okay now here s my interpretation of boomer based on the facts as presented in the new york court of appeals holding boomer v note the new york court of appeals is the highest court in new york state while the united states and of the fifty states call their highest court supreme court supreme judicial court or supreme court of appeals maryland and new york call theirs simply the court of appeals to make matters worse new york also calls its second highest court the supreme court appellate division atlantic cement co n y d n e d oscar h boomer et al owned land near the atlantic cement company s plant near albany n y the fact pattern gives no information as to which came first the plaintiff s acquisition of the land or he defendant s start of production at their cement plant in the course of its regular operations the cement plant did injury to the plaintiffs property via dirt smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief that is they asked the court to order atlantic cement to stop damaging their property commentary this seems entirely reasonable to me boomer at al owned their property and presumably a right to quiet enjoyment of it atlantic cement s actions were depriving boomer et al of that right instead of granting the plaintiffs request for an injunction the court ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property provided that atlantic cement paid them in compensatory damages in other words the court granted atlantic cement co a private party the power and authority to take the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain a taking by eminent domain is always problematical even when it s done by the state allowing a private firm to do it is in my opinion totally wrong yes i know the boomer court didn t call it eminent domain but if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain let me take issue with the way you ve presented the case you say that what happened in boomer was that the judge didn t allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi million dollar plant to be shut down over in damages blackmail pulls out black s law dictionary abridged th edition blackmail unlawful demand of money or property under threat to do bodily harm to injure property to accuse of crime or to expose disgraceful defects this crime is commonly included under extortion statutes how do you define as blackmail one party s act of demanding the right to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns and which another party has expressed an interest in buying or of demanding the right not to sell that property at any price as i see it boomer et al having found themselves in the fortunate position of owning something which atlantic cement had to purchase if it wanted to stay in business had every right in the world to set whatever price they wanted there isn t or at least shouldn t be any law that says that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings you go on to say the plant would never have been shut down the plaintiff s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than k to having the plant shut down while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation if so so what since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties if atlantic cement didn t want to have to face a choice between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business well shouldn t atlantic cement have thought of that before going into business i note that as far as the facts show boomer et al were not the parties responsible for bringing about this situation that was atlantic cement s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type of plant they did where and when they did and then you say everyone s property rights were protected the plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were avoided as above i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were made whole they were in fact by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them and for that deprivation they were not made whole and again i ask since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that unnecessary settlement costs are avoided if so i ve been miseducated i always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done is boomer really being taught as infamous that s really sad if it is because i fail to see how it s less than completely sensible you should read the law and economics stuff first hand instead of filtered through teachers who clearly don t like it for whatever inexplicable reasons boomer is not being taught as infamous at least not at my school aside northeastern law usually does a very good job of hiring for their first year mandatory classes such as torts where i first encountered boomer instructors who regardless of their personal opinions can and do teach the law neutrally when the students get into their second and third years in which the students a can pick and choose which courses to take except for the mandatory professional responsibility of course and b are presumed to be a bit more worldly and self confident less likely to be consciously or sub consciously intimidated by law school professors and able to learn from openly biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them the instructors tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions this is especially true of part time instructors who in real life are practicing attorneys or sitting judges this can be very educational sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat cloistered scholar end of aside i called it infamous because that s my opinion of it for the reasons i ve stated above i believe it to be a triumph of something that i can only call economic correctness over justice it is completely sensible only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and the alleged right of several hundred atlantic cement employees to not have their jobs disappear should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by atlantic cement s wrongful acts and if you believe that it is correct for the courts or any other branch of government to grant to private parties the right to take other people s property by eminent domain you d like posner bill he s a libertarian really i didn t know that what if anything has he had to say about cases like boomer of course he has too much of a paper trail to ever be nominated by a president democrat won t like his antitrust stance or republican won t like his support of gay marriage and if bright law students shiver at what they don t understand it s easy to imagine how the press will play it up as baby selling i ve seen mike godwin claim that posner asserts that law and economics is applicable to everything and is the end all and be all when posner says precisely the opposite so it goes i ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as law and economics is weak if it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many tie breaker factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute as measured by the scale of justice is evenly balanced fine but as illustrated by boomer it is not fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case william december starr wdstarr

to humans that were not available to slaves not necessarily distinctions were made between citizens and persons throughout the u s and various state constitutions for example free blacks had some rights of citizens but not all the rights of citizens i m curious if there was an additional level of distinction made by the slave states to rationalize their treatment of slaves or if they just ignored the theoretical problems of slave ownership the bill of rights as far as i can see does not once refer to citizens but it makes several references to people for example article iv the right of

personnel roa s executive director maj gen evan l hultman aus ret suggested concern that the only plausible alternative is that they are intentionally attempting to foreclose the naval reserve components from maintaining even today s relatively low level of participation in their parent service s total force of the future he asked the commission to remove from consideration all locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to warrant approval of the requested action only a few of the naval and marine corps reserve installations on this list are large enough to have a significant impact on the community if closed wrote hultman the major issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large percentage of the existing locations hultman reminded the commission the fact that the vast majority of the reserve installations on this list do not come close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this process certainly supports the thesis that these actions are simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the navy and marine corps reserve roa also noted that at the end of the s when the number of naval reservists was approximately the same as today there were naval reserve facilities if the navy recommendations are approved there will be less than naval reserve facilities facilities on the list include seven naval air stations ranging from south weymouth mass to alameda calif naval reserve centers in macon ga and parkersburg w va to missoula and great falls mont naval marine corps reserve centers include four

summer jobs conference the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april remarks by the president at summer jobs conference hyatt regency crystal city virginia a m edt the president thank you very much the speech that octavius gave says more than anything i will be able to say today about why it s important to give all of our young people a chance to get a work experience and to continue to learn to merge the nature of learning and work why it s important to honor the efforts of people like jerry levin and nancye combs and pat irving and all of those who are here i want to thank the secretaries of labor and education and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this and my good friend governor wilder for being here and for speaking and all of the business and local community leaders from the city and county and state level from around america who are here this has been a pretty fun day laughter i loved hearing the young people sing it was music to my ears because it is their future that we are really struggling about applause a year and a half ago i began the quest to seek the presidency because i was concerned about their future because i believe that our country which had always been a beacon of hope for the young had too little opportunity was too divided among ourselves across lines of income and race and region and other ways without a vision to take us into the future i entered with the hope that together we could create more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of our people but in the process we might recreate the best of america s community knowing that together we could always to more than we could individually and that we might secure our future all of you here today are committed to that the jobs that jerry levin has committed time warner to is symbolic of the commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here and those who are around the country the work that nancye combs does and the successes of all the young people like those on this stage and especially the eloquent statement octavius jeffers all those things show that together we know what we need to do and we re on the right track last july when i was traveling across america s heartland in my luxurious bus i visited seneca high school in louisville kentucky and there i met young people and business people who were participating in the louisville education and employment partnership i saw what nancye combs talked about today i saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed both in school and at work i saw as i have seen many times in my own state the principle illustrated that octavius has talked about that for millions of american young people it is really an impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what is learning in the world in which we are living the average young person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a lifetime we must learn to merge the work world and the learning world much better and we must determine that all of our young people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased here today whether you re in business or in government or in education you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to building a future that really honestly includes opportunity for all of our people there are still a lot of people who say well things are pretty good here in washington and everything s fine the best thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing they all have jobs laughter all the people who say that applause they all have health insurance they all have a pretty good education and they all have a pretty secure knowledge that they ll be okay no matter what happens i say that not to be either political or unduly critical but to point out that one of the great challenges of this age for every advanced nation everyone is to fully develop the capacities of all of its people and then find work for them to do all the european countries have higher unemployment rates than we do but also stronger support systems for the unemployed the japanese unemployment rate has been going up they re going to adopt a stimulus that even if you count it in its most rigorous terms is three or four times bigger than the one that i have proposed to create jobs in west germany alone the unemployment rate is now about as high as ours this is a big problem for advanced nations it costs a lot of money to add an extra employee with a lot of pressure from low wage producers in other countries that are growing their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their people but it is especially important for america for two reasons one is we have a whole lot of folks who unless we move aggressively will not have the education and skills we need to be competitive and productive in a nation like this the second is even if we educate them all if there aren t jobs they will be robbed of the fruits of their educational labors people need to be able to work in this country applause we have always had some unemployment and indeed some of it is normal you ve always got some people leaving jobs and moving around the country and doing first one thing and another we have now at this moment in our history the necessity for all big organizations including the government to reexamine the way they are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working at some kinds of jobs but in the whole we must still be able to create jobs in a country like america to provide people with the chance to work it s going to be difficult for me to make the welfare reform proposals that i will make to congress in the next couple of months it s going to be hard for me to make those work if at the end of all this work to get off welfare there isn t a job applause so we have two tasks one is to develop the capacity of the american people to perform without regard to race or income or the circumstances of their birth the other is to make sure that there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck it is a great challenge i do not pretend that all of the answers are simple but i know if you want to ask the american people all of them to be more responsible if you want to recreate a sense of community in this country that bridges the lines of race and income and region you have got to have opportunity in that mix a part of our vision for america has to be a future for every young person in this country who s willing to play by the rules and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow there has to be something at the end of that rainbow and that is what we are basically here to talk about today what can we all do as partners recognizing none of us can do it alone to develop the capacities of our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their background and then what can we do to make sure that there s something there for them to do the summer jobs program we re discussing today is an integral part of that plan because it will promote the values of work and opportunity and fairness community it will put the people first and it does have a partnership between the public and private sector i said when i addressed the united states congress in february on this program that i would seek to create about extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the american business community to meet that target so that we can create more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been created before many many people have responded to that challenge and jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in this room and around the country people who are going to do more than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people a work experience and it is terribly important i want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the american people from retraining defense workers who lose their jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills to improving the transition from school to work for young people who don t go to college but do need at least two years of post high school training either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting so that they can be competitive workers making it possible for more people to go on to college who do want to go all these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive plan it s also important as i said that we create more jobs the emergency jobs program that i asked the congress to adopt would create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half and that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent it would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work force in jobs that otherwise will not be created it also will help a lot of cities and counties to invest in things that need to be done at the grass roots level projects long delayed water projects sewer projects park projects new industries and particularly in small and medium size communities a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve the environment the summer jobs program is an important part of that because we have tried for the first time through the work of the labor department and the education department and through reaching out to people like you to make this more than just a one shot summer jobs program to integrate it with private sector efforts to hopefully replicate it in each coming summer to move these young people into further educational opportunities and to further job opportunities and to have a strong meaningful education component to these summer jobs something that the united states government has never fully emphasized before a lot of these young people as you well know because they come from difficult backgrounds because they go to school in difficult and challenging circumstances need extra help in building their basic skills in math and language reasoning and in other areas and a lot of educational studies show that young people who have difficulty in school often forget as much as percent of what they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next year what we are trying to do here is to give people the opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning skills and to put them together and then hopefully over the next couple of years if our entire program passes to give every school in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning environment there will be more applied academics more opportunities for people to learn and work during the school year so that this will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks but will be a part of building a whole new educational experience a whole new work experience and moving on a pathway to a better future the summer jobs programs are not designed to be make work jobs they re designed to make a future for the people holding the job and that s what they will do in the process they ll help to build local communities to strengthen local economies to solve local problems real jobs renovating housing repairing public buildings doing clerical work providing nursing assistance in hospitals supervising and training children at child care centers and learning all the way challenging young people to learn while they earn but letting them earn you know it s very difficult to make a case to people who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should do this that or the other thing if there s no evidence of the opportunity that s at the end of the effort i have not been sparing in going for the last year and a half into places where it isn t exactly popular to say it and say i wanted to reform the welfare system i wanted to toughen child support i wanted to require people to work i was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the use of guns on the streets and i wanted to change all that but if you re going to summon people to greater responsibility you have to reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity applause the young people we propose to put to work under our program will spend hours learning basic skills such as math reading writing either on the job in the classroom they will stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat they will have a sense of accomplishment it will literally be a summer challenge but a challenge that will take them into a different life so i want to ask all of you to support this effort even as i as your president support your effort at the end of the summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate we ll see whether they instead of falling behind over the summer academically as too many young people do they stayed even or moved ahead i suspect that they will this summer secretary reich and secretary riley and i will be visiting many of your communities we ll really try to learn from you which of these efforts are working what we should do next summer how we can build it in to what goes on during the school year how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing so that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private investments as well we want to honor the companies and the communities the business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this summer and again i want to say to all of you in private business who have matched our effort i thank you and to all of you who haven t and those across the country who may listen or learn about this event today i want to implore other private employers to stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this summer i m telling you we cannot go through another years when we don t give these children anything to say yes to if we exhort them to do right we ve got to be able to reward them applause when the other speakers were talking i was sitting up here on the platform listening and reveling and they got talking about work and i got to thinking about all the different things i ve done to make a living in my life when i was i made a very foolish short term business investment i set up a comic book stand and sold two trunks full of comic books made more money than i had ever had in my life but if i had saved those trunks they d be worth today laughter that does not mean young people should not be entrepreneurial it just means that you can t foresee a generation ahead i have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership and i ve done a lot of different things for a living some people say i got into politics to escape work laughter i learned something from every job i ever had but i grew up in a generation where i literally did not know a living soul without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn t have a job i grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to people is get an education and you ll be all right you ll get a job and you ll make more money next year than you did this year now i live in a generation full of people most of whom don t make any more money in real dollars than they did years ago and they re working longer hours and they re paying more for the basics of life and we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these young people want now i want to close by reemphasizing these two things it doesn t matter what kind of economic policies this administration pursues or how much productivity increases there are in the private sector if young americans don t get a good education don t learn how to work and can t be productive those jobs will not be created in this country machines will do the work or the work will be done off shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wages so nothing we can do economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of america s work force and anybody that pretends otherwise is just kidding on the other hand we need to be honest every wealthy country in the world including the united states is having difficulty creating jobs if i knew everything that needs to be done i d be glad to tell you and we could just call off the whole deliberations of congress and everything else i don t have all the answers but i know this doing nothing is not the answer applause and so the jobs program that i have presented to congress with the summer jobs with the money for the cities and the counties through the community development program with the infrastructure money is a small part of a big budget it is an attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not with the economy recovering in terms of corporate profit we can give a little boost to it give opportunities to young people create a half a million jobs and maybe get the engine going again most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in the private sector not government jobs even though it s government money and the lion s share of the work in rebuilding the american economy obviously will come from the private sector that s the kind of system we have and it works pretty well but this is the challenge we have so i ask all of you here today to support the summer jobs program to ask your friends and neighbors to support it to go back home and ask your employers to make a little extra effort to do what you can to help me pass the funds to create the jobs that the united states government should create this summer so that together we can have this partnership because more than anything else we have to give a future a future that our young people can believe in we need to send them a message that here in america if you study hard and work hard if you obey the law and contribute something to your community you will be rewarded by your country you can build a future from you own dreams that has always been the promise of america together that s what this summer of challenge needs to be a reaffirmation of the promise of america for so many young people to whom that promise has been an illusion we can make it a reality thank you very much applause end a m edt\n", "label": "politics"}, {"text": "clinton press briefing by george stephanopoulos the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april press briefing by george stephanopoulos the briefing room p m edt mr stephanopoulos i guess i m just prepared to take questions today q george bob dole says that the clinton administration s policy on bosnia is a failure and that he wants the united states to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that the bosnian muslims can defend themselves mr stephanopoulos as you know president clinton has said that that suggestion is under active consideration obviously this is a tragic situation in bosnia and if the bosnian serbs don t come to the negotiating table in a constructive way we ll look seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo in the meantime we re going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in the u n we re going to continue to work on the serbs to come to the negotiating table but the prospect of an arms embargo is something the president certainly will consider if the serbs don t come to the table q how much longer are you going to give them to come to the table george mr stephanopoulos we re working on that right now q it s been a long time q on february th the president mentioned the value added tax in ohio and when he was asked about it later by reporters he said quote that is a radical change in the tax system of the united states it s something i think we may have to look at in the years ahead questioned again about it later he says it is not something that is now under consideration if we start considering it i ll tell you it wasn t a trial balloon or anything he said i was just discussing the tax response to a question donna shalala quoted in usa today this morning quote certainly we re looking at a vat what s gone on q the same with alice rivlin this morning mr stephanopoulos the health care task force is reviewing a number of options they haven t made any decisions yet and as i have said from this podium time and time again we re not going to comment on decisions that haven t been made q but you have also said from this podium time and time again q wait a minute whoa nelly whoa q that that was not under consideration q yes clinton says it is not something that is now under consideration is that no longer true mr stephanopoulos i believe the working group as ms shalala says has looked at this prospect but no decisions have been made of any kind q well i know but he said he d tell us about it if it was ever under consideration i take it that now he is and he didn t tell us about it or mr stephanopoulos did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed q if we start considering i ll tell you mr stephanopoulos if it s something to be proposed q if we start considering it i ll tell you that s a direct quote mr stephanopoulos the task force has looked at a number of different options they have not made any decisions yet the president has not made any decisions yet this is one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care system they have cast a very wide net they have looked at hundreds of different proposals probably thousands of different proposals but the president has not made any decisions q well is the president aware of their consideration of this option mr stephanopoulos i don t know if he s been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind i don t know that that s gotten to his level he started yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decisions and i don t believe that that s been presented to him no q well he s not relying on the usa today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of taxes mr stephanopoulos no he s going through it in a very deliberate fashion there are a number of decisions that have to be made i don t know that this proposal has reached that decision making point q if this is still under consideration that s a change at least from what we ve been told by dee dee i think about three weeks ago or so she said that is not an option talking about the had a big argument with somebody over this so i remember it specifically and said it not once but twice is that not the case mr stephanopoulos again i don t know if this has been presented to the president as something that is being looked at at some level in the task force q it was ruled it out though i mean unlike other options that you ve kept in the mix this one specifically was ruled out mr stephanopoulos again this is something that is being looked at but no decision has been made of any kind i mean it doesn t it s not necessarily material until you get to the decision making phase the working groups are looking at hundreds of different options q if it was ruled out before and it s not ruled out now then something has changed george yes no q when a guy says in february mr stephanopoulos well the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of options q so something s changed they weren t looking at it before they re looking at it now mr stephanopoulos well i don t know if the working groups have gotten to that point yet they are casting a very wide net q how was it possible that you and dee dee were able to sell definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that in fact it is being considered mr stephanopoulos again the working groups are looking at a wide range of options they have not q do you deny that you and dee dee ruled it flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month mr stephanopoulos i don t deny that i mean those are the president s words those are very clear q subsequent to the president s words do you deny that within the last month you and dee dee have both publicly ruled it out mr stephanopoulos i don t know about the timing i think what we did was refer back to the president s words and say they stand q so don t they stand any longer q march th clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled out mr stephanopoulos well those words the president did say that in february the working groups are on a separate track and as i said i don t believe q separate from the president mr stephanopoulos i don t believe this has been presented to the president q are they considering something that the president q has ruled out q has ruled out i mean will the president consider a vat tax mr stephanopoulos again the working groups have not presented this to the president they have looked at a wide range of options i suppose that if an argument is made he will clearly listen to it that does not mean he has decided to do it q can we put this another way in his answer in ohio he looked at the vat in terms of restructuring the whole tax system under those that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future point is that no longer the case or is that the only way that he can see a vat emerging mr stephanopoulos i guess i m not sure exactly what you re asking q he talked about the vat in the context of a restructured tax system not as a specific way to finance health care for example q or anything else q or anything else q it was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system mr stephanopoulos right q has that change too q is that still his view mr stephanopoulos i haven t spoken about those specific comments i think i can just go back to it are the working groups have they examined the possibility of a vat yes they have q certainly we re looking at a vat she said mr stephanopoulos they have examined the possibility of a vat has it been presented to the president has he made a decision no he has not q what kind of a deal do you have when you ve got the president s appointed task force obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later and then goes ahead and announces that that s what they re looking at is the president concerned about that sort of thing mr stephanopoulos i think that the president s concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal possible he s concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives all the different alternatives if a decision is made to go forward with something like that it s certainly something the president will explain and justify but no decision has been made along those lines q what does it mean exactly though when the president rules something out does it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument is made mr stephanopoulos that s just that s indisputably true if you but at the same time he has not ruled it in he has not made a proposal q what makes him open to it now when he wasn t open to it before mr stephanopoulos he s certainly willing to listen to the argument q was he willing to listen to the argument for a short term tax this year and he wasn t willing to listen to it in chilicothe he s now open to it mr stephanopoulos the context of his comments was that it was not something he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing not something he was floating q not something he was considering those are his words it s not something that s now under consideration if we start considering it i ll tell you you re now acknowledging are you not that it is under consideration and mr stephanopoulos i m acknowledging that the task force has studied this proposal i am also stating that the president has not made a decision on it q but the door is open for the president to reconsider including this as part of mr stephanopoulos obviously the working groups are looking at it again but the president has not made a decision q do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the vat to him mr stephanopoulos i don t know that i assume that if i don t know what stage they are it in proposing i don t know that they re going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to him i know this is something the working groups are looking at q do you understand george that none of us are asking these questions in context of a decision that the president has made only about what the president is considering mr stephanopoulos i understand that and i am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a vat q and the president will consider it mr stephanopoulos i assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to him q does that mean the president that working groups think that when the president says no he means maybe laughter mr stephanopoulos i think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible q george can i ask you another question about bosnia mr stephanopoulos sure laughter q no he wants us to stay on this q let s do gays in the military laughter q no he got out of that swamp q i think we ve gotten the bottom line on that vat reggie bartholomew your special ambassador in belgrade today said that if the serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out quote we will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies that seems to go a bit further than what you ve just said mr stephanopoulos sounds almost exactly what i just said q well do you accept in other words you accept what reggie mr stephanopoulos well the president has said that this is something that s under consideration it is something he will consider if the current actions don t bring the serbs to the table q isn t there some kind of timetable here mr stephanopoulos yes there is a timetable there s going to be a vote on the u n resolution in about days q that s on sanctions that s on tightening the sanctions mr stephanopoulos that s right that s sanctions and we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure and we hope that that will bring the serbs to the table as you know mr bartholomew also met with mr churkin of russia and they are also working on ways to bring the serbs to the table we will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as well q the question is whether there s a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo not the sanctions mr stephanopoulos the next vote in the u n is on sanctions as far as i know there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms embargo but it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our allies q why did reggie bartholomew tell the serbs that the u s would do that what was the point of his telling them that mr stephanopoulos well clearly i mean this is something that s under consideration and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table they should know the consequences of failing to come to the table q have they been given a deadline q warren christopher has been saying the same thing and it hasn t seemed to change the serbs behavior in the least why should the serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything that s been done has had no effect on the fighting in bosnia mr stephanopoulos i just don t accept the premise of your question it has had an effect the embargo is having an effect q what effect mr stephanopoulos if the serbians choose not to heed our warnings then they will face the consequences q what effect has it had in bosnia mr stephanopoulos well the effect that it has had on the serbians it has tightened up they are not getting their shipments through we can brief more fully q in bosnia george in bosnia what effect has it had mr stephanopoulos well it s hard to say if it s stopped the aggression to date that is why we re continuing to press for the serbians to stop but we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the serbs and that will have an effect i m not saying it s going to happen overnight it clearly hasn t happened overnight but we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the serbs if it fails to work and if the serbs fail to come to the negotiating table we ll move forward with the embargo q isn t there a working deadline george of the th the same date as the u n the scheduled u n vote hasn t the united states said along with many of the other nato allies that if the serbs aren t willing to sign on to the peace accord by then that we ll seek haven t we said that we will seek mr stephanopoulos we ve said continually we re going to q but on that deadline mr stephanopoulos i don t have a specific date but we re going to move forward with the resolution the u n resolution by around that time and if that fails to take effect if that fails to bring the serbs to the table we will clearly consider other actions q isn t this awfully incremental mr stephanopoulos we re taking a step by step approach we re ratcheting up the pressure and we re going to continue to do that q is there a possibility george that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the serbs will have achieved their goals and then what s the purpose mr stephanopoulos i think the purpose is to get the serbs to stop the aggression we are pursuing that goal on many different fronts we are pursuing it through the u n we re pursuing it through direct talks we are pursuing it through tightening the sanctions and we will consider lifting the arms embargo we are turning the screws up on the serbs and we will continue to do that q but if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the serbs give back what they ve gained i mean once they re entrenched mr stephanopoulos i can t speculate on that we re going to continue to press for them to come to the table now we re going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression but i can t see into the future q george on the stimulus package house republicans say they re going to hold a series of town meetings on saturday to try and explain the details of your package they cite polls which show that the more people learn about it the less they like it what s your strategy to counter that mr stephanopoulos the strategy we have is the one we re going to continue as you saw the president today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive work we are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money the investments in highways we re going to point up the benefits of immunization we re going to point up the benefits of head start we are going to say that the republicans have a choice they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years q does it concern you though that the house now the house republicans are after you as well as the senate mr stephanopoulos the house republicans voted against it before they made a mistake then they re making a mistake now q george does it strike anybody in the administration that it s a bit strong to describe as the president did this morning the summer jobs program as quote a reaffirmation of a promise of america mr stephanopoulos not at all i think it s the promise of america to give kids a chance to reach their full potential q government funded jobs mr stephanopoulos to give people a chance to work absolutely that is the promise of america q i want to follow up on something i asked yesterday where does summer jobs where does that figure come from mr stephanopoulos that is on top of i did look at it there are currently summer jobs in the pipeline this will be on top of the so it will be a total of million q the would be created by the stimulus package mr stephanopoulos yes q where does that number come from because we ve been told all along that the stimulus package would create new jobs and according to panetta that breaks down to something like full time jobs and summer jobs mr stephanopoulos yes but the summer that s when you do their full time equivalence i mean individuals will receive jobs this summer when you calculate it for the full time job effect you have to do i don t know what the exact formula is q seven hundred thousand part time jobs mr stephanopoulos or q one to four because it s three months mr stephanopoulos thank you q can i follow up on that did the president misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private for kids to work in the private sector mr stephanopoulos not necessarily i mean i think that there will be grants available that s one of the ways that you pay for the jobs at the same time he s also issued a challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as well q tax dollars for instance would pay for kids to work at time warner mr stephanopoulos i think the time warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant that s going to be the bulk of it there could be isolated instances though where there would be grants to businesses q has the president spoken with any senate republicans this week mr stephanopoulos no but there s been a lot of contact with senate republicans in the white house q at a lower level but the president hasn t mr stephanopoulos the president has not no q getting any closer to get the votes mr stephanopoulos we re continuing to work on it q anybody leaning your way q on haiti the new york times seems to be reporting something of a breakthrough in aristide s attitude towards the coup leaders can you confirm that there has been this change and what impact will it have on the process and what did pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report mr stephanopoulos pezzullo did brief the principals i can t confirm what s actually happening in the talks i would leave that to the negotiators themselves but mr caputo has returned to haiti we have received a briefing here at the white house from ambassador pezzullo and as we have said time and time again we believe that assurances of security are important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement q george yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted mr stephanopoulos i think we have it for most states yes and i think we can get it out q could you make that generally available mr stephanopoulos i believe we can q and could you do it by the component of the stimulus in other words mr stephanopoulos i don t know if we can do i know that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs i don t know how deeply it can be broken down but clearly we can break it down into summer jobs and other jobs q and can i follow up is this the information that jeff eller and the rest of the white house is using in the ads in the states mr stephanopoulos i don t know if they re ads but they re press releases q can you describe what those press releases contain mr stephanopoulos all we re doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various states for instance i know that today senator dole is heading up to vermont and new hampshire and i would point out that the stimulus package the jobs package creates jobs in vermont it creates jobs in new hampshire and the people of those states should remind him that this is important q where are the releases going mr stephanopoulos they go to the states q to whom mr stephanopoulos we can get them it s no problem q can we get it q why don t you put them out here as well mr stephanopoulos i think we can q this afternoon would that be possible mr stephanopoulos i ll have to check i don t know but as soon as we can q are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic republican senators mr stephanopoulos i think we re trying to get as many as we can it s actually quite difficult to pull this together and we re doing our best we re putting them out as we get them q why are you so closely tracking senator dole s schedule mr stephanopoulos i was just following it q are press releases going along to states where he s visiting mr stephanopoulos i m not sure i think that probably there are press releases going to vermont laughter q will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting laughter q george as the president goes about the business of defending what s in his stimulus package he doesn t address what seems to be the republicans main point that you re funding it with deficit spending rather than if it s so important why not come up with the funding for it seems to be the republican argument and how do you answer that mr stephanopoulos what was answer is we are paying for it over time and if you look at our budget we pay for this package over time we believe right now the economy needs a jump start for jobs q you re not claiming are you that that doesn t add to the deficit this year mr stephanopoulos i m saying we re paying for it over time i didn t say that q i know that george but i mean from the beginning the question we do have annual budgets and things deficit spending will pay for that this year will it not mr stephanopoulos this year they clearly will but over time our budget fully pays for this program q what you re saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years mr stephanopoulos absolutely that s exactly what i said q i know that but there is going to be outstanding debt it will add to the national debt from this year mr stephanopoulos no we re reducing the deficit by billion billion over the next four years q you mean you re reducing it below what it would have been mr stephanopoulos exactly q in fact you re adding a very large amount to the national debt over the period of mr stephanopoulos but we re reducing it far more from what it would have been that s true q washington type reduction laughter q you re getting to be a grumpy old man q george has any decision been made about the white house or the president s participation in the gay rights march coming up in a week and a half mr stephanopoulos we re working on the president s schedule now i believe he s going to be at the senate democratic retreat in jamestown that weekend q will he address it by phone mr stephanopoulos i don t know about that it s a little far out but i believe he s going to be in the senate retreat q so will he have the leaders in a day or two before the speech mr stephanopoulos i don t know i would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups i don t know the schedule on it though q will there be an aids czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event mr stephanopoulos i m just not sure q april nd is earth day what is the president going to do to mark that and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day mr stephanopoulos i know there s been some work on the biodiversity treaty i don t know about signing it that day but i would expect he ll have a statement on earth day or right around then q where is the work on the biodiversity treaty mr stephanopoulos i d have to check with katie mcginty i just know that there s been some work done but i don t know exactly what q when is earth day mr stephanopoulos the nd i think q why is it you know that he is going to have a statement on earth day but you don t know if he s going to have a statement on the gay rights march mr stephanopoulos i said i don t know if he s going to meet or when he s going to meet q do you have a statement on the gay rights march mr stephanopoulos i don t actually no i wouldn t be surprised if he did though q do you have some details on the miyazawa visit mr stephanopoulos it s a working visit on friday and the president is looking forward to that in discussing a number of issues including russian aid and the japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two countries q there was some expectations that a second aid package to russia was going to be unveiled at the g meeting and if i understand it hasn t happened why is that or what s the status on that mr stephanopoulos the g meeting is still going on and as you know secretaries bentsen and christopher have talked about the outlines of a possible package but we re going to continue to consult with congress and our g allies on that q we will not then make any kind of announcement during the two day meeting mr stephanopoulos the meeting s not over yet q is that when you re going to make one mr stephanopoulos i m not ruling out the possibility q the president s going to announce it tomorrow q bentsen said that q yes bentsen said it would be tomorrow q so did christopher mr stephanopoulos i d have to look at that but i believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of tokyo q george has there been further consideration here about going to sending the president out to los angeles mr stephanopoulos i don t know that there s it s not something we ve ruled out we don t have a date set for it q george you all have a position or do you support immigration s plan to settle iraqi prisoners in the united states mr stephanopoulos it s the first i ve heard of it q george there was a report today about the q fortunately laughter q about the pace of appointments and says that president clinton is behind president bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated for are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it mr stephanopoulos we filled of the president s appointments and it s broken down we have schedule c noncareer ses pas full time i m not sure what that means laughter pa full time and this is about the same it s about the same pace of president bush obviously as you move along farther once you each level of appointment actually has a multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments so we expect the process to speed up but we re at the pace of bush obviously we d like to get these done as quickly as possible i would point out that the fbi background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors and that is part of the holdup but we re working on it q is that because of nannygate mr stephanopoulos i think that s an awful big part of it yes q in the story this morning you were at approximately the same pace as bush in making appointments but way behind in winning confirmations mr stephanopoulos that s where the background checks comes into play that s the problem q that s the background checks problem because i mean you have a democratic senate mr stephanopoulos no that s not the you make the appointments and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks done that s exactly where the problem is q what s the president doing this afternoon and what s on the plan for tomorrow mr stephanopoulos he s got some meetings just office meetings this afternoon for the most part on a variety of issues that probably a half dozen different issues and then he ll be tomorrow we ll have an event probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the white house and friday is the miyazawa meeting q will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow george mr stephanopoulos either tomorrow or friday q is there going to be a pre briefing regarding the japanese prime minister s visit tomorrow mr stephanopoulos i don t know about tomorrow but we ll probably get something done as we usually do for these visits q was reverend jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about mr stephanopoulos he was here he met with a group of us here at the white house including mack mclarty q who q reverend jackson mr stephanopoulos reverend jackson mack mclarty me gene sperling bruce reed jeff watson mark gearan q talking about haiti mr stephanopoulos we talked about general urban policy he is about to go to los angeles he was just back from mississippi where we had a good victory last night and he s going on to los angeles q did he request the meeting mr stephanopoulos actually no he s in continual contact with the president he had written a letter on a variety of issues and so we asked him to come in and talk about it q george dole is having a fundraiser for jeffords tonight in vermont have you guys been in contact with jeffords at all on this mr stephanopoulos i think there s been some contact sure q can you tell us about the contacts mr stephanopoulos i m not sure q do you know who contacted him or what was said mr stephanopoulos i know that howard paster talked to him and they just has a general talk about the package q and did he express his support for it now or is he mr stephanopoulos i can t divulge the details of the conversation but there have been conversations q the l a times is reporting that abortion elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care package is this something the president is considering mr stephanopoulos again q along with the vat laughter mr stephanopoulos it s certainly something that s been looked at but no decisions have been made q what was the question mr stephanopoulos the l a times story on whether abortions will be covered by the president s health plan q did the president in his meeting did you in your meeting with reverend jackson ask his advice solicit his advice about what kind of stance the white house should take in the wake of the verdict in l a mr stephanopoulos well we certainly talked about the situation in los angeles and the long term prospects for economic development and other issues q for instance did you discuss whether it would be helpful for the president to go there or not mr stephanopoulos well we discussed a wide range of issues related to los angeles that was certainly one of them q letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in i need to go back to bosnia just for a second and ask mr stephanopoulos oh good q your reaction to margaret thatcher s comments that you re just sitting by and watching a massacre mr stephanopoulos well we ve been pushing very hard on a number of fronts for more aggressive action we will continue to do that q can you tell us if you ve made any progress in your talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise i mean we don t have any feel except talks are ongoing have you talked to like people or mr stephanopoulos i don t know the numbers we ve talked to several people and we ve had wide ranging sessions q anyone leaning your way mr stephanopoulos i can t get into that we re just going to keep working through tuesday the press thank you end p m edt\n", "label":

fascism with a friendly face does rush limbaugh remind you of anyone daevid bornhuetter machen the madison edge the main difference between adolf hitler and rush limbaugh is that hitler was original and showed initiative mort sahl on the tom snyder radio show abc radio network october nlns believe it or not i was planning this comparative review of mein kampf and limbaugh s transcribed rant the way things ought to be before sahl issued his comparative review as usual sahl s was independent and sharp as a scalpel my effort can only dream of comparing favorably to mort s at least it has a fairly popular orginating premise everyone i d mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the acts of those false prophets both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions in fact limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over million almost identical to the number of votes cast for hitler in the april german election both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt the last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books hitler s example is when on page he claims the german nationalist terrorist leo schlageter he bombed part of a railway line between dusseldorf and duisburg being caught in the act in was betrayed to france by a representative of his government when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement in fact the governments of both the reich and prussia as well as the vatican actively intervened to save him from execution and almost succeeded limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places god is unconstitutional of course it s not god but the official imposition of particular concepts of god against an individual s will that s unconstitutional but limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that of course one would assume that by comparing the two books my main point would be that the way things ought to be is the modern american mein kampf not really at the time of the first german version of mein kampf hitler was just four months out of prison june and trying to reorganize the nazis he used the book to build his dozen million followers limbaugh on the other hand came up with his book after building his dozen million twelve million went a longer way in weimar germany that it does in the republicrat united states thus the more accurate parallels would be that limbaugh s daily three hour radio show is the american mein kampf the primary propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume and that the way things ought to be is actually the american triumph of the will a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium also the printed word was the more important medium in weimar germany since radio was still being thought of by impoverished germans as a medium of luxury in today on the other hand americans are more likely to spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop for pages of transcripts of the same words but as mort sahl also observed on the radio the other night some cloutmeister of the radical right wants limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda and remember sahl is an al haig conservative these days mort might not know exactly who rush s equivalent of rodolf hess is the book itself suggests ed mclaughlin the former president of abc radio and now limbaugh s partner in efm media the radio program s production company but mort himself is a veteran of the talk show having hosted them in new york washington and los angeles he knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men he knows that limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as al capone did it s almost worthy of a rico indictment on questions of social issues there is an overabundance of material in the limbaugh book that seems to echo hitler s venom for example on their own qualifications to control society hitler out of the host of sometimes millions of people who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth partly perhaps understand it one man author s emphasis must step forward in order to form with apodeictic force out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses granite principles and to take up the fight for their sole correctness until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises page limbaugh who needs the media when they ve got me the show is devoted exclusively to what i think the phrase with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even denotes the egress of mental aptitude i require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me it might take four or five years but i m convinced the media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking kicking and screaming all the way pages and respectively on religion as the basis of a nation hitler in this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the aryan his dying off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture he who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the lord sins against the benevolent creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from paradise page limbaugh america was founded as a judeo christian country but our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion people for whom belief in god is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years is it only a coincidence that the quality of american education has declined ever since pages on popular culture as a reason for social collapse hitler the fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in one has only to look at the menus of our movie houses vaudevilles and theatres and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food theatre art literature movies the press billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of state and culture pages and limbaugh today hollywood is in trouble the reason is that hollywood has forgotten who its audience is they make fun of people who believe in god they ridicule the traditional family heterosexuality and monagamy they disparage american heroes page on the news meida hitler the activity of the so called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the german people and the german reich one can pass by in silence the marxist papers of lies it s task is only to break the people s folkish and national spine in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters the jews page limbaugh elements of the media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes the cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes during the gulf war cnn correspondent bernard shaw said cnn is a global network we can t take sides cant take sides if they don t realize that their freedom lies in the united states of america and that therefore they should defend this nation they are hopelessly misguided and may i suggest flirting with megalomania pages and to continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading after putting these books down there is one undeniable fact that haunts me in the s adolf hitler fed depressed and frightened germans the opiate of hatred of those around them in turn it allowed germans to hand their collective national power to the nazis in the s rush limbaugh is doing the very same thing distributing hatred to depressed and frightened americans in turn it is helping the american radical right to maintain its power base as the year nightmare of the reagan bush era comes to an end hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for the fascist states of america and if limbaugh is not as repellant a

actively addressing the crisis in the former yugoslavia the security council acted in resolution to establish a ban on all unauthorized military flights over bosnia herzegovina there have however been blatant violations of the ban and villages in bosnia have been bombed in response to these violations the security council decided in resolution of march to extend the ban to all unauthorized flights over bosnia herzegovina and to authorize member states acting nationally or through regional organi zations to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance nato s north atlantic council nac agreed to provide nato air enforcement for the no fly zone the u n secretary general was notified of nato s decision to proceed with operation deny flight and an activation order was delivered to participating allies the united states actively supported these decisions at my direction the joint chiefs of staff sent an execute order to all u s forces participating in the nato force for the conduct of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by the united nations over bosnia herzegovina the u s forces initially assigned to this operation consist of f and f a fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft these aircraft commenced enforcement operations at a m e d t on april the fighter aircraft are equipped for combat to accomplish their mission and for self defense nato has positioned forces and has established combat air patrol cap stations within the control of airborne early warning aew aircraft the u s cap aircraft will normally operate from bases in italy and from an aircraft carrier in the adriatic sea unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching the no fly zone will be identified interrogated intercepted escorted monitored and turned away in that order if these steps do not result in compliance with the no fly zone such aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by nato military authorities and in accordance with the approved more over rules of engagement although we do not expect such action will be necessary the commander of unprofor the united nations protection force currently operating in bosnia herzegovina was consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully considered before the rules of engagement were approved it is not possible to predict at this time how long such operations will be

steve hendricks writes as noted in another thread limiting govt the problem libertarians face is insuring that the limited government they seek does not become the tool of private interests to pursue their own agenda believe it or not we liberals are frequently as opposed to anti competitive measures as you conservatives we don t believe however that competition will necessarily be protected by the actions of business interests in a free market after all in the example you cite it was not liberals that pressed for such regulations but good staunch conservative businessmen as adam smith so eloquently demonstrated the free market is not something that capitalists seek to protect when they can profit from its elimination the same point was made by marx a point of agreement between the two theorists that should tell us something i do not want the government to become a tool of private interests limited government cannot insure that private interests will not use this government for their own agenda agreed but this is not a failure of libertarianism it is the fact that utopia is not an option there is no single system where everything is perfect it is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams just as marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and the state is to wither away libertarians frequently fail to show how weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human condition so it is wise to look for the best solution if you compare countries to see which ones people would rather live in which ones have less starvation hunger poverty and misery you will find that they have a more limitted government than countries with alot of poverty misery and suffering no limitted government cannot insure anything but it sure is better than the alternative big government this is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds in this case limited and big government are not defined i would point out that lebanon somalia and the former yugoslavia are by some definitions nations with limited government while the us canada and nations in western europe where people would rather live are often pointed out as nations with big government from a libertarian point of view the argument is not between those who want limited government and those who

thesis in real life go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory look in the first chapter of that book introducing the field of macroeconomic theory right there in chapter section is a statement like the following as it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently the province of individuals who create new inventions and discover new ideas we will assume for the rest of this book that there is no wealth creation we do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently unpredictable subject is impossible even though we assume no wealth creation we do believe that for most mathematical economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid as it allows

on the excessive force charges koons for incompetance and powell for overreacting both guilty as heck even from the view of nypd cops interviewed that might get out of hand also some elements may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops a dumb move obviously and koreans are still scared and certain people are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year a commander

post below i have considered issues far outside the scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome thus it is tangentially relevant to soc history and alt revisionism but i have directed followups to t p m since it is principally consideration of the political lessons to be drawn from the history of the nazi party that i deal with in article apr oneb almanac bc ca kmcvay oneb almanac bc ca ken mcvay writes as dawidowicz points out in the holocaust and the historians harvard university press the nadir in hitlerology is reached by david irving s hitler s war an amateur historian whose reputation as a german apologist and as a writer without regard for accuracy or truth won him a measure of notoriety irving produced a page work intended to show that hitler was kind to his animals and to his secretaries that he was probably the weakest leader germany has known in this century and that he did not murder the jews or even wish to do so but that the murder was committed behind his back without his knowledge or consent let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case does this mean that hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent supporter one of the important things to realise about the nazis is that the system was far more evil than any single member once created the nazi party itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide there was noone within it strong enough to prevent it remember that hitler did not originaly lead the nazi party nor was he particularly powerful within it until his oratory allowed the party to come to power had hitler reneged upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications of their rhetoric this is why all parties that espouse nazi style race supremacy ideologies must be considered as dangerous and as evil as the nazis the idea that one race of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome the gas chambers of auschwitz the nazi party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray beyond the evil of individuals there was the evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego cult centered on the demonstration of his own power this does not however mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and his propagandists worked so hard to assert the myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be emphatically rejected in the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best i would accept only the latter as a strong government since most displays of strength are made necessary by an essential weakness it is important to understand that the nazis were not stupid nor were they amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples they acted in the same manner as the spanish inquisition murder and torture in the cause of morality the fault of the nazis lies in their axioms not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axioms thus all such parties such as the national front or david dukes klu klux klan front who assert the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are advocates of a system that would commit genocide the conclusion that hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is inescapable from the historical record it is important though to not let the conclusion be reached that the nazis espoused a set of ideas that were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent the evils of the concept of race supremacy are primary although this most emphaticaly does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary no matter what the promises made by a racist supremacist party upon election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit if this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made the pledges that will occur hatred is a supreme justifier it also creates a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign for many in government politics is a method of providing a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance a rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician thus we have the us raid on tripoli which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power it is important to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice in the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology it is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants the leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily are required to stive to do so thus to take on such a task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime furthermore in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole before personal concerns even of personal security although it was inevitable that a party such as the nazis based upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded each member of the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility of changing the dynamic realising that the individual cannot hope to control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot

we have far fewer shootings like this we have had i believe one mass murder in the last twenty years i m not going to say we don t have our gun problems but we do have the world s largest undefended boarder with one of the most gun happy countries in the world i think canada illustrates that gun control does have an effect in fact it s suprising that there is any difference considering how easy it is to smuggle a gun from the u s yes it s amazing isn t it in fact it should tell you that gun control is not the reason your crime rate is low since any idiot can smuggle guns into canada from the us at any time i think paul was trying to make the point that any idiot doesn t there are surely some idiots who do smuggle guns but paul seems to feel that the exis tence of stricter gun control laws has had a deterrent effect this seems a strange argument to make considering that canada s violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the u s our non gun crime rate is greater than their entire crime rate it would seem strange to suggest that it to were the result of gun control laws i think if we looked we d find very specific cultural and enforcement reasons why the non gun rate is low as well and then that reasons could be applied to the with gun rates as easily given that most criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who purchase them legally having more restrictions on legal possession does seem to have the effect of reducing gun related crimes aside from the fact that i find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution it still doesn t address the question of canada which is now by the way blaming their rising gun crime rate on the u s strange that the border used to magically keep the guns out but now isn t it certainly makes sense that it would well it makes sense to some of us anyway the other side of the coin of course is that far illegal drugs are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally i ve still not been convinced that guns a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources stolen either from police military or civilian we wouldn t simply see south american sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well since there s a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there if you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics you would realize that our non gun crime rate is also very high so guns per se are not the issue directly contradicted by the nejm study that compared crime in seattle and vancouver b c the non gun rates were roughly the same for both cities the difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun related and as was not pointed out in the study but in critiques of it two seperate articles by james wright and david kopel come to mind it was pointed out that the difference was also almost entirely minority related that is the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities blacks and hispanics primarily while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical the problem with the nejm study was they compared minority vs non minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities that there was an eqaul percentage of nomn whites was about as far as they went they failed to take into account that the non whites in either city were not living in the same conditions if the situation was entirely based on availability of guns then we d expect that the white rates the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities would have a far higher rate in seattle yet the majority in seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded but slightly lower violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city surprise pick the area with the highest incidence of poverty drug use disease etc since rates are lower in suburbia us middle class folks can ignore the problem the point is of course that many of the u s inner city problems are not mirrored in canada as such if there is a condition which is significantly different in canada from the u s and violent crime is highly correlated to that area suggesting that gun control is the source of canada s low rate is highly questionable as one canadian pointed out on talk politics guns canada s major gun control in did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates which have been rising steadily since apparently they didn t even mirror the u s s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already post hoc ergo propter hoc those areas implemented gun control because of the high rates true only to a certain extent take washington d c where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards similarly for new york the question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime since it s gone up in those areas often faster than it was going up before you can t simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it yes gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime but if the crime is not positively impacted you can t continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented just as happened in canada similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control as would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control and the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in washington d c may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for

maddison etc were up to from them there are a couple of ways to look at them one is we want you to support this constitution so we ll say anything that we think will appeal to you or the more straightforward this is why we think what we ve suggested in this constitution is a good idea you clearly consider the former to be the primary situation the point is that they did not make pains to point out where the consitution may have been aginst the new yorker s interests also they did not want to raise opposition by basing their advocacy on unpopular principles horrors appealing to popular principles can we perhaps as the question of whether the constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles rather than as you appear to believe it was written with something else in mind and propoganda put out by its supporters but let s be honest about something here when was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments or are they simply propogranda we can t know what phill really means because he s obviously using arguments designed to convince well i know hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist and probably the authoritarian extreme to jefferson s democratic impules but what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we don t consider what they wrote about the government i don t propose that any means exists for determining their true opinions thus their true opinions died with them and are of little help today their opinions have not the slightest bearing on the matter though only their arguments these are true or false regardless of who said them or why if they re true or false regardles of why they were said why on earth did you make a point of calling them propogranda that would seem to be irrelevent the difficulty that most us posters seem to have is in considering that their arguments may have been flawed or no longer apply to modern societies oh i have no argument with questioning them i don t believe they no longer apply but that s because i think most of them were good arguments i m not entirely happy about the situation because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time but i don t think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them if they were alive today the one opinion we could count upon these men to express is that a careful study of the mechanisms of government is necessary and that an ongoing improvement of the same is required they gave their opinions in certain areas and have been proved right in other areas they got it wrong they ensured that there was a mechanism to adapt and improve the consititution this can only happen if there is a willingness to accept that the structural problems within the us political system may require constitutional change as a solution since the u s constitution is the basis for the u s political system most changes in it would require constitutional change in this particular case however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition it only should have been made part of the constitution if the senate was less powerful than the house of lords than we d almost have to state that the house of representatives was also in fact they both were because the british government had much greater power than did the american system in principle no in practice yes in principle no that they had less power of that they should have had less power the british government today is theoreticaly dependent on the will of the monarch by convention any monarch seeking to exercise that power is deposed the subtly is that the prime minister is not able to identify their politics with the national interest in the same manner that us presidents regularly do phill we re discusing the power of legislative houses while the prime minister is member of parliament he is more analgous although badly to the u s president now please explain to me how the u s house of representatives is in principle more powerful than the house of lords or the senate but in practice is less are you suggesting that the writers of the constitution really intended for them to be more powerful but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they d forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the senate in i disagree the system is not too slow it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle as somebody in washington put it whose name i forget congress has become everybody s city council one reason for that is that at every level the government is rendered unable to come to decisions these decisions are pushed up to the next higher level instead not at all as any entry level political science course will tell you people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to attack which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want with national interest groups it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the federal government to enact a law rather than the states less people to persuade and less contributions to make why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the federal level simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension the same extends to insurance medicine and most other questions local government has not failed in that it hasn t done what it should but that it is dominated by local interests thus non local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can t get their rules past the local government thus since they ve got more clout only in the wrong place they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower i mean let s get real here do we really need the congres of the united states deciding that x traffice light should be on thus and such pattern or that carjacking needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime the more people want the more congress will take power to sell it to them for their votes i don t think the rise of special interests is coincidence with the increased power of congress congress is more than capable of quick action and has more than enough power and time on its hands if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy if they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current no state subsidy motto they would be better placed as it is there is plenty of state money being handed out the problem is that it is distributed on the basis of power in congress and not on the basis of actual need bingo the higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters because political power can be concentrated at higher levels while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness in order to set up a school project in new york state you have to pay off the other states with pork defense contracts agricultural subsidies etc or to be precise of the states since you need to beat the filibuster then why not simply leave new york s education to new york i remain unconcinved that there is any state in the union which is not capable of educating its own children if that s what they want to do and if you leave it to them you only have to worry about the pork in that state and since industries can t concentrate their political power and wealth rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want individual voices have more relative impact the problem with the fillibuster is not that you must buy off states but that the congress has acquired too much power to sell pork it is not a case of the system of government they created failing but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid namely a concentration of power it would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either house in some attempt to grease the wheels all you ll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things it would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level no you have to break the machine free of seizure before you can redirect it but why on earth should we want to redirect it you said yourself that you have to sell pork to get things through congress if congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction the pork problem is significantly reduced the current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility to come to a decision the current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action thus it the system is weighted against action considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force i consider bias against making those decisions a good thing pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won t work unless the lower levels are less corrupt in most cases they are worse not better the difference with the lower pyramid is that a they have more legal legitimate authority in most matters under our constitution than the federal government and b at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate and c you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once you get to see them tried out without a national decision congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole yet even with similar problems in different areas different solutions may be called for and while i often don t agree with the decisions my local and state reps make at least i have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off i d much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in washington with half a million or more constituents i m curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt i fail to see where any restrictions implied or otherwise were placed on the veto it could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise in the executive s opinion policies since we were arguing from the federalist papers i would point to them phill you brought up the federalist papers we were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of senators should be allowed to hold up a bill you claimed the senate was suppose to be a far less powerful house and i contended there was nothing in the constitution or other writings which indicated this which was when you brought up that we can t decide what the founders wanted based on the federalist papers you argued against them i never argued from them i have primarily referred to the constitution which places only very small restrictions on the senate than for the house the us constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work the only part where a reason is given is the right to bear arms ammendment where the well regulated militia justification is ambiguous the u s constitution is a nuts and bolts document the delcaration of independence was the high brow reasoning there are a couple of other examples though such as the reasoning for the power to tax and the reasoning for the power to grant permits both in article i section that the veto was meant to be an exceptional measure follows from the fact of the senate if the president was meant to revise legislation then there would be three chambers of the legislature not two furthermore the separation of powers would have been much less distinct to a certain extend i do believe the veto has become something it wasn t intended however i also believe it is inevitable considering the congress own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say unlike most people i think we shouldn t be worrying about the veto which is fine but of the problem in congress which almost necessitates its abuse there is no limit in the constitution to the president s veto power regarding what a bill is for previous presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons most usually having something to do with their agenda i am really curious how you single bush out as the president who abused vetos he has the record for vetos bush phill that s absurd bush had vetos one of which was over ridden go read up on fdr if you think that s anything resembling a record why is it not a reasonable restriction because senators is the magic holy number upon which laws must be based if senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster isn t that enough to indicate there s a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re evaluate it up to a point the fact is though that when the majority are opposed by a minority the minority should not be allowed to win by default why not what is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action historically governemnt action in the u s when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful when you re in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority why one earth should be sufficient to enact a law which covers million people in very very diverse places and living in radically different conditions why shouldn t a super majority be required because the bill at issue is a money bill relating to a short term proposal now we re switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill i don t see how it make a difference it is not a change in the law where a presupposition in favour of the status quo is arguable sure it s arguable theyr e arguing it however requiring to bring it to a vote ensures that they ll have to have a good argument something that isn t based solely on party lines any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority will be ignored i do not see this as a positive thing and for all that i m sure the republicans are looking for pork as much as the democrats they ve got some legitimate objections to the legislation in question so instead you consider a system under which the minority automatically win to be superior no i am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for action since u s history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece meal on minorities i feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about and is hardly a tiny minority i don t advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but i see no problem with biasing

this city phoenix has a relatively small black population black people seem to be responsible for a disproportionate amount of violent crime yesterday black men robbed a cafeteria beat the employees for no apparent reason and shot one dead even though they were being cooperative a few days ago a car full of black men opened fire on a car containing a young white couple and their baby possibly because they didn t like the way the man was driving the baby was slightly injured these incidents are not even unusual even if a white person starts out without racial prejudice as after all we all do and no one teaches them to be prejudiced it s sometimes hard to see how they can avoid becoming so based on their own observations and instinct for self preservation we always taught our children that racial prejudice is wrong not only bad but also mistaken but how do you counteract the effect of these kinds of incidents what s the answer how can we work against racial prejudice when incidents like this keep fanning the flames what can we say to deny that racial prejudice is a rational response to our environment is it should we since the s i have thought the only hope is through integration based on ignoring race and treating each person as an individual but so many either preach divisiveness by emphasizing race or validate racism by their actions where does it lead alan filipski gtx corp e camelback road phoenix az usa internet al gtx com uucp uunet gtx al phone alan you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators of crimes no more represent the black community than racist hateful whites represent the majority culture although there are many ethnic minorities who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with and believe otherwise the trap is the easy way out for yourself i think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement you re going to find higher crime within any community comprised of any ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction with ethnic minorities it is more usually than not as i said socioeconomic disenfranchisement if for example you lived in an area where there were very few blacks but quite a few poor for generations whites you d see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those white people would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see whites as undesireable or whatever the trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define us and other raises its little voice the trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans it s interesting that blacks are traditionally seen as the or the most criminal element in many of our urban areas i don t know the racial makeup of phoenix so i can t speak to your situation however i live in san francisco a city that loves to tout its ethnic diversity here we have black gangs hispanic gangs asian yes the model minority gangs and even a few white gangs the asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here mainly due i think to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities but ask people on the street and they ll out of times tell you that black gangs and crime are what they most fear during the disturbance in los angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not black some were even white i remember being amazed at television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two blacks at most my perceptions gleaned from tv news were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in los angeles this may have been the country s first truly multi ethnic riot yet i know from face to face and online discussion that in the minds of america the popular perception is that it was a black riot in closing i d like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion our country has spent too long ignoring the racism and its attendant ills that is very much a part of our culture as a people we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths and the problem becomes compounded daily we cannot afford to do it much longer i

insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in canada but doctors take home pay is almost equal to american doctors also minimal bureaucracy cos the system is so o o simple early march part of the deal for using the all insurance approach like the french and germans do hey why don t they criticize france and germany is it because too many people take french and german in college to make the accusations stick was to preserve the doctors independance since the provincial wings of the cma are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented the politically bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like britain s national health service you ve got to remember you ve got a waiting list as well but it s not as obvious if you re poor and you don t have insurance you don t go to a surgeon in the states you ration by ability to pay for non life threatening things market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand i have md friends who can t make a living as specialists back in manitoba not due to the insurance

from weeks ago about canada s health insurance approach on talk politics medicine there is one small error in the article not all of our hospitals are private wouldn t national health insurance mean that americans who are now fully insured might have to settle for less in canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private hospital rooms so many canadians do end up buying some private insurance a policy to cover all of these things runs about to a month of course the one thing to note is that in the canada france germany case private insurance offloaded the basic coverage to the public sector they realized they were keeping low risk high profit extra insurance for things like private semi private rooms vs ward accomodation dental glasses etc for corporate or personal benefits they ll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care at that point they wouldn t even consider a voucher approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff wouldn t free care encourage people to run to the doctor for every ache and pain people who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospital about a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical bills still canadians who pay nothing at the doctor s have a lower per person health bill than we do it is free in that there are no deductibles nor copayments two things which i advocate to make the canadian insurance look more like real health insurance which actually it is i know that when working in alberta ontario and quebec i was aware that i was paying for health insurance e g in toronto ohip fees were listed on my pay stub manitoba did not collect at paycheque time but only annually at income tax time built into the tax rate only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it s free along with the canadian left for that is part of

health needs for life are not viewed as market but the insurance does allow the market to address that basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a vcr as americans would see it plenty of room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as lastly there were noises about how the canadian system was not containing costs but in fact their system is currently

april interview of the president by michael whitely of kdka am radio pittsburgh pittsburgh international airport pittsburgh pennsylvania a m edt q for everyone listening on kdka radio i m mike whitely kdka radio news we re here at the pittsburgh international airport and with me is the president of the united states bill clinton and i d like to welcome you to the area and to kdka the president thank you mike glad to be here q there are a lot of things we d like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have but some news is just breaking from los angeles i guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath wondering what s going to happen in the trial of the four los angeles police officers we just heard that two of those officers the sergeant sergeant koon and officer powell have been found guilty and two officers have been found not guilty it s a situation that s been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict and i wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in los angeles in connection with your administration and what you re trying to do the president well first of all i think the american people should know that this trial in my judgment is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the case the law under which the officers were tried is a complex one the standards of proof are complicated the jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the beating the jury acquitted an officer who kicked rodney king but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows and another officer who was a rookie no one knows exactly why they did what they did but it appears that they really tried to do justice here they acknowledged that his civil rights were violated and i think that the american people should take a lot of pride in that but i hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things first of all the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any american secondly the importance of renewing our fight against crime i think it s important to recognize that in the poorest areas of los angeles and many other cities in this country people may be worried about police abuse but they re even more worried about crime it s time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing put more police officers on the street pass the brady bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drugs and the last point i d like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically distressed areas if you just think about it if everybody in los angeles who wanted a job had one i don t think we d have quite as many problems as we do and i laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our cities i have dispatched the commerce secretary ron brown to california to try to come up with some strategies for that state because it s our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate which could then be applied around the country i want to talk to him and to the attorney general to the new head of the naacp to reverend jackson and to several other people and then i ll decide where to go from here with regard to los angeles and the other cities of the country q let s talk about what brings you to the pittsburgh area today there have been i guess there s been a lot of discussion on capitol hill about your stimulus package you ve been locked in a battle with the gop yesterday as you said earlier in your radio address you made some moves to break that gridlock what brings you to pittsburgh in particular to allegheny county in particular to pennsylvania with that battle the president well there are two reasons first of all pittsburgh allegheny county and pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic policy we have passed our overall economic plan it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we ve had in the previous we reduced the deficit and at the same time increased investment in jobs and education and health care in the things that will make us a stronger country but in addition to that i asked the congress in the short run to spend a little more money a modest amount of money to create another half million jobs in the next year and a half to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more the plan passed the house it has the support of a majority of the senate at the present time all the republican senators as a bloc are filibustering the bill that is they won t let it come to a vote i believe that senator specter would like to vote for the bill and i believe that senator dole the republican leader has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the republicans to stay hitched and they re all saying that this bill increases the deficit it doesn t this bill is well below the spending targets that congress approved including the republicans for this year this bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five years this bill is designed to give a jump start to the economy and i must say a lot of the republican senators that are holding it up when mr bush was president voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs so what i m trying to do is to break this logjam i ve held out an olive branch i ve offered a compromise but i think that we ought to try to put some more americans to work right now to show that we re changing the direction of the country and that s the purpose of the bill q have you been in touch with senator specter or his office lately the president well we ve been trying to talk regularly to through my white house congressional liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this senator specter senator d amato from new york senator jeffords from vermont senator hatfield from oregon and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget i presented you know it has a lot of appeal to say well we ve got a big deficit we shouldn t increase it more but the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few years and more importantly we have this program well below the spending targets that congress has already approved for this year and they ve done this for years with the republicans voting for it many republicans voting for it for things that weren t nearly as important as putting the american people back to work so i just hope that this doesn t become a political issue it ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for jobs q i have some questions from people who supported you and some people who are skeptical about your administration it has to do with their hopes and also with their fears a lot of people who supported you and voted for you in pennsylvania i think some of them are now saying we re glad we got him in the white house but now look at this incredible process he has to go through look at these problems look at this gridlock and they re beginning to wonder is this going to work can you pull it off and of course your skeptics are saying well i knew it was going to be like this the president well what i would i d ask people first of all to remember that we are frankly moving very fast the budget resolution that the congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution ever in history setting out the next five year budget targets so we are moving really rapidly and we ve got them working on political reform welfare reform health care reform a whole wide range of things but it s a big operation you can t expect to turn it around overnight it took years to produce the conditions which led to the victory i received from the people in november and we can t turn it around in days but i think we re making real real progress i would urge the people not to get discouraged we re not going to win every battle and not everything is going to happen overnight but we are definitely moving and changing things q thank you very much the president of the united states bill clinton here live at pittsburgh international airport i m mike

radio address to the nation by the president pittsburgh international airport pittsburgh pennsylvania a m edt the president good morning my voice is coming to you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio station in america kdka in pittsburgh i m visiting the city to meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs health care and the economy but i wanted first to do my weekly broadcast with the american people i m told this station first broadcast in when it reported that year s presidential elections over the past seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with the people from whistle stop tours to fire side chats to the bus tour that i adopted along with vice president gore in last year s campaign every saturday morning i take this time to talk with you my fellow americans about the problems on your minds and what i m doing to try and solve them it s my way of reporting to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable you sent me to washington to get our government and economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad experiment with trickle down economics you know how important it is for us to make bold comprehensive changes in the way we do business we live in a competitive global economy nations rise and fall on the skills of their workers the competitiveness of their companies the imagination of their industries and the cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business labor and government although many of the economies of the industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth they ve made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which our government has for too long ignored that s why many of them have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been falling behind we have an economy today that even when it grows is not producing new jobs we ve increased the debt of our nation by four times over the last years and we don t have much to show for it we know that wages of most working people have stopped rising that most people are working longer work weeks and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating cost of health care but we also know that given the right tools the right incentives and the right encouragement our workers and businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better places to live in many critical products today americans are the low cost high quality producers our task is to make sure that we create more of those kinds of jobs just two months ago i gave congress my plan for long term jobs and economic growth it changes the old priorities in washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to be on people s real needs on increasing investments and jobs and education on cutting the federal deficit on stopping the waste which pays no dividends and redirecting our precious resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the groundwork for robust economic growth in the future these new directions passed the congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our country then the jobs plan i presented to congress which would create hundreds of thousands of jobs most of them in the private sector in and passed the house of representatives it now has the support of a majority of the united states senate but it s been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the senate just senators they blocked a vote that they know would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs the issue isn t politics the issue is people millions of americans are waiting for this legislation and counting on it counting on us in washington but the jobs bill has been grounded by gridlock i know the american people are tired of business as usual and politics as usual i know they don t want us to spin or wheels they want the recovery to get moving so i have taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra mile yesterday i offered to cut the size of this plan by percent from billion to billion it s not what i d hoped for with million americans looking for full time work i simply can t let the bill languish when i know that even a compromise bill will mean hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people the mandate is to act to achieve change and move the country forward by taking this initiative in the face of an unrelenting senate talkathon i think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant portion of our original goals first we want to keep the programs as much as possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs including highway and road construction summer jobs for young people immunization for children construction of waste water sites and aid to small businesses we also want to keep funding for extended unemployment compensation benefits for people who have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn t creating jobs second i ve recommended that all the other programs in the bill be cut across the board by a little more than percent and third i ve recommended a new element in this program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against crime by providing million for cities and towns to rehire police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put them back to work protecting our people i m also going to fight for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it and deserve it now the people who are filibustering this bill the republican senators say they won t vote for it because it increases deficit spending because there s extra spending this year that hasn t already been approved that sounds reasonable doesn t it here s what they don t say this program is more than paid for by budget cuts over my five year budget and this budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the congress this year it s amazing to me that many of these same senators who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of emergency spending and much of it was not designed to put the american people to work this is not about deficit spending we have offered a plan to cut the deficit this is about where your priorities are on people or on politics keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar for dollar it is paid for by budget cuts and it s the soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our children i urge all americans to take another look at this jobs and investment program to consider again the benefits for all of us when we ve helped make more american partners working to ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy you know if every american who wanted a job had one we wouldn t have a lot of the other problems we have in this country today this bill is not a miracle it s a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country again but it s a step we ought to take and it is fully paid for over the life of our budget tell your lawmakers what you think tell them how important the bill is if it passes we ll all be winners good morning and thank you for listening end a m edt\n", "label": "politics"}, {"text": "re new study out on gay percentage in article apr romulus rutgers edu kaldis

yugoslavia are by some definitions nations with limited government while the us canada and nations in western europe where people would rather live are often pointed out as nations with big government from a libertarian point of view well let me help by explaining the difference between a linited government and a failed government a limited government has its powers clearly circumscribed but is fully capable of enforcing its decisions within those circumscribed areas a failed government is incapable of enforcing its decisions except sporadicly two completely different beasts of course one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government power and keeps it circumscribed in a complex society when it is in the interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using government power for their own ends but apart from that little conundrum it would seem that a society with a failed government would be an ideal setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented now why do you suppose that never seems to occur the argument is not between those who want limited government and those who want unlimited government it is between those who believe government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds regulation is such a vauge word i wouldn t call it vague i d call it elastic all regulation is not necessarily the same by opposing all government regulation some libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that

regulation is obviously worthwhile the libertarian agenda however does not call for this assessment it assumes that the costs of regulation of any kind always outweigh its benefits this approach avoids all sorts of difficult analysis but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic to say the least i assume you mean that analyzing the cost benefit ratio of government regulation on a case by case basis is worthwhile let me suggest that this is not an option regulators regulate it s what they do i m not sure why you don t consider it an option no one suggests that such analysis should be left to regulators in fact the re inventing government movement provides just such a cost benefit approach to the analysis of public spending libertarians would do well to learn more about it it might be possible to pass an amendment which would prevent any liscensing laws from being valid assuming you could convince people that it would overall be a good idea eliminating the liscensing laws which serve no good purpose the vast majority of them while maintaining the worthwhile ones assuming there are any is not feasible sorry but it strikes me that it is the only feasible approach what is not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent tasks i have no objection to an analysis of medical care education national defense or local police that suggests a free market can provide a more effective efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through statist approaches with some notable exceptions however i do not see such nitty gritty worthwhile analysis being carried out by self professed libertarians jsh i note that the above examples tend to be among the few government areas likely to win some approval among libertarians anyway actually the only areas of public spending above that strike me as generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense it is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to be to a principle of non coercion the only areas of public spending that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns hmmm the most objectionable government expenditures are entitlements which also are the biggest certain individuals will suggest that these should be considered defense on the grounds that

posting to this group who is not probably has the wrong group for example i have on numerous occasions stated quite clearly that i beleive that certain factions of the gun lobby are the worst possible advocates of their cause and i am prepared to do anything in my power to provide them with a platform because they can convince people far better than i could hope that many people with a fixation on lethal weapons are dangerous and derranged if you happen to know a political position which does not have people advocating it who do more harm than good please point it out some people have even accused me of inventing such advocates purely for the purpose of having them trash a set of political views in fact this would be a futile tactic because i could never hope to invent a character as

weapons should be available so if you were to ask me what is the point that i am trying to make from this current argument on the absolute sanctity of the us constitution what would i answer we are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the u s constitution in fact the fillibuster we re talking about isn t in the constitution i objected to your suggestion that the senate wasn t intended to exercise the power it was clearly given firstly i see that the current us political scene like the uk political scene has become tied to special interests rather than chase the convenient caricatures put about by the media and polititians themselves for this gay rights cmapaigners environmentalists zionists i e jews foreign lobbyists whatever voting power they have etc i sugest that you look at who is really benefiting the inevitable conclusion is that it is the major corporations owned by the ultra wealthy that have benefited regan and bush created what can only be described as a welfare state for the rich i ll point out again that reagan only had a republican majority in the senate during his first term and his coalition in the house came apart at about the same time bush never had any real support in congress the real point is that everybody everywhere got their pork from the big corporations to the guy i saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk food he d bought with food stamps he spent more in food stamps on junk than i make in a week and i m not on government assitance money was diverted from programs addressing social needs and poured into the weapons industry in the form of cost plus profits contracts lessee let s pull out the old almanac in total u s government budget outlays were billion dollars in est they were trillion dollars an increase of approx billion dollars in national defense cost billion dollars in it was billion dollars and increase of billion dollars that leaves an increase of billion dollars unaccounted for this represented an increase of in income security which includes retirement programs housing assitance and unemployment benefits and i believe welfare cost billion dollars in it was billion dollars or more than national defense started this represented an increase of in the federal government spent billion dollars on medicare in they spent billion dollars an increase of in the feds spent billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like in it was billion in health care services and research was billion dollars in it was billion dollars agriculture up billion to billion science up billion to billion resource conservation up billion to billion education up billion to billion veteran benefits up billion to billion trasnportation up billion to billion about the only things i see which was seriously decreased was under the energy category primarily under supply and community development in the area of disaster relief and between the two of them represent a loss of less than billion dollars where was this huge diversion in order to rectify this situation there must be constitutional revision not that s a stretch if the current government was pushed by the president to create this mess wouldn t one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone secondly the form of this revision must take account of the changed circumsatnces of the role of the federal government only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue i see very little positive about it the constitution cannot be used to frustrate the democratic process the constitution was designed to frustrate the democratic process so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened nor do i see putting the brakes on the democratic process an inherently bad thing califronia s riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse if the peoplr want to have welfare spending by the federal government they will have it sometimes or perhaps most of the time the people should be told no and pointed to their local government attempting to prevent this through constitutional trickery only leads to the constitution being brought into disrepute phill would you do me the very great favor of repeating that in talk politics guns methods will always be found to bypass such provisions and once the government gets used to bypassing those provisions they will bypass the others up to the first ammendment cute we can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating the law this is a major reason why the right to own guns should be excluded the implication that this right is equal to the right to free speech is dangerous free speech alone is dangerous phill people know that mass ownership of lethal weapons causes thousands of murders a year the dangerous conclusion they may reach is that the first ammendment may also be the same dangerous mistake ok phill all you gotta show me is a clear pattern of reduction in homicide rates across several countries and that ll be it not current mind you reduction note however that this is not the slippery slope argument it is because the right freedom of speech has been chained to the privilege to own weaponry that the danger arises the advocates of this pivilege must not be allowed to chain freedom of speech to their cause such that if they fall freedom of speech falls as well such actions are not the actions of people genuinely interested in freedom who s chaining anything to freedom of speech by calling it a freedom thirdly and most importantly i want to discover a mechanism wherby i can engender intellectual debate as opposed to totemic debate i consider the grave threat to civilisation to be the loss of the ability to reason about the political debate at anything other than the superficial level the objection i raise to your basing your case entirely on the assertion of the supremacy of the us constitution is that the currency of your argument is limited to the currency of the totem upon which it is based the danger of totems is that they can be reinterpreted in different ways by different people phill you re a master of subtly changing the subject i haven t based my argument against raw democracy on the constitution i ve tried to explain why it isn t a good idea the only time i ve

little conundrum without having a complete answer to this question i should think it obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be a desirable result there are still quite a lot of people who feel that the command economies of eastern europe failed due to corruption rather than essential weaknesses of caommand economies and you still have a majority in this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on the books in order to send a signal it would seem that a society with a failed government would be an ideal setting for libertarian ideals to be

they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable society anyway regulation is such a vauge word i wouldn t call it vague i d call it elastic all regulation is not necessarily the same by opposing all government regulation some libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that regulate relatively free markets as identical that s one reason many of the

we if the monarch tried to do something what would happen if they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current no state subsidy motto they would be better placed as it is there is plenty of state money being handed out the problem is that it is distributed on the basis of power in congress and not on the basis of actual need bingo the higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters because political power can be concentrated at higher levels while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness that was not my point but you illustrated the problem very well in order to set up a school project in new york state you have to pay off the other states with pork defense contracts agricultural subsidies etc or to be precise of the states since you need to beat the filibuster then why not simply leave new york s education to new york i remain unconcinved that there is any state in the union which is not capable of educating its own children if that s what they want to do the point is of redistribution of cash from the poor areas of the ecconomy to the rich ones i am contending that there is no state in the union which does not have ample wealth if they choose to spend it to run a perfectly acceptable education system i further contend that the amount of money being spent now is more then sufficient but is being spent badly or vice versa if you aren t a republican so tell me phill were the republicans also responsible for some of the huge increases in social programs or were they only responsible for what you don t like i contend it is congress which is to blame democrat and republican alike if society simply writes off any areas of the country that is ecconomically weak you end up with a basket case ecconomy there are inevitable cycles in any business some of these act in phase to produce the business cycle others are countercyclic localities can experience boom to bust cycles outside the national trend to produce a strong ecconomy you need to ensure that the bust areas do not fall bellow the level where they cannot be ecconomically rebuilt most of our worst areas are still better off than most of europe in any case we re talking about education if the industry in an area collapses the us as a whole still has a responsibility to ensure that the children in that area get a good education in some areas of the us schools are closing halfway through the year for lack of money yes i live in once such area you re woefully ignorant of the situation at the same time some of tennessee s school districts are closing down the governor asked for million dollars for bicentenntial celebration license plats in almost the same breath he wanted to raise unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it i don t know about the rest of the country but our education problems stem directly from two problems neither of which are a lack of money in the state btw tennessee is considered a tax heaven and our economy is one of the strongest in the country i see a correlation what money we spend goes primarly to administration the average administrator makes two and a half times what the average teacher makes and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue and the governor is making a concerted effort to create an education crisis in order to push for his pet income tax some of the most idiotic programs get funded like state funds for new art in the county seat while schools are closing it s not a lack of funds it s an unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate education is the parental hot button education is always the first to but cut because it s easier to get people to pay for their children than ugly art the u s constitution is a nuts and bolts document the delcaration of independence was the high brow reasoning there are a couple of other examples though such as the reasoning for the power to tax and the reasoning for the power to grant permits both in article i section the declaration on independence cam a decade earlier and has not a line of justification for the us constitution you could argue that it went into the broad concepts but little more it spoke very eloquently on government being based on the consent of the governed in fact it is little more than a protracted whinge more to do with the price of tea than the design of a government it would be a pretty daft idea for a bunch of guys to sit arround designing the structure of the new government while the little matter of the british army remained to be settled they did it anyway the continental congress had its own set of bylaws it wasn t quite a government but a means of making decisions had to be created however low george washington s opinion of them were to a certain extend i do believe the veto has become something it wasn t intended however i also believe it is inevitable considering the congress own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say unlike most people i think we shouldn t be worrying about the veto which is fine but of the problem in congress which almost necessitates its abuse the congress is the most democratic body in the whole system allow me again to speak heresy against the holy democratic orders so what the government was built with a very non democratic presidency with fairly broad powers including the veto it has not only the fairest system of election but the two year term means that the members have always got a recent mandate yes and the senate was intended to act as a balance to this too much democracy was intentionally avoided it was considered a good thing to place non democratic blocks to impulsive action on the other hand if the period of election were to be made years in antiphase to the presidential cycle there would be much less dependence on fund raising from special interests than there is at present so long as congress has something to sell people will pay for it most congressmen rake in more money than they need why not what is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action historically governemnt action in the u s when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful when you re in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority in other words david thinks that the reactionaries should need only votes while progressives should need no if the progressives don t want the reactionaries to move backward they get the same benefit of the states is a lot of people and historically laws with that sort of minority arent very effective especially since it is usually geographically concentrated when wielding the federal big stick i don t see why they shouldn t have to make a better argument than more people than not agree now we know why nobody calls the republicans democrats i m not a republican i m a republican and no i m neither a democrat nor a democrat now i ve asked several times and all you ve done is answer it isn t democratic which i knew before i said it why should it be democratic we don t have a true

insurance and maybe that s not such a good thing i also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in canada to litigate against the health system class action suits are nearly impossible and you can t sue the provincial health officials at all part of the deal for using the all insurance approach like the french and germans do hey why don t they criticize france and germany is it because too many people take french and german in college to make the accusations stick was to preserve the doctors independance since the provincial wings of the cma are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented the politically bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like britain s national health service oh no don t let the ama know about this they have enough power as it is ask most americans whether they d like the doctors lobby to get more powerful for non life threatening things market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand i have md friends who can t make a living as specialists back in manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won t get enough customers the cma medical monopoly s grip on doctors licencing as in the us aside so they must move to larger places however this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent and routine care as has been done in the u s by consumers reports health policy studies cited by prof dennis e shea on usenet cnn nyt etc well yeah tell us about the national defense medical centre outside ottawa theoretically it s limited to service personnel but some studies i ve heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren t urgent at all the problem is in a system where hospitals annual budgets are approved by the government how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions i bet that if you re an mp or mpp or good friends with one you re put on any hospital s urgent care list no matter how minor your problem which is ok unless you re someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot wouldn t national health insurance mean that americans who are now fully insured might have to settle for less in canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private hospital rooms so many canadians do end up buying some private insurance a policy to cover all of these things runs about to a month hmm how much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of gnp spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting maybe canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do of course the one thing to note is that in the canada france germany case private insurance offloaded the basic coverage to the public sector they realized they were keeping low risk high profit extra insurance for things like private semi private rooms vs ward accomodation dental glasses etc for corporate or personal benefits they ll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care at that point they wouldn t even consider a voucher approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff so what happens if the health care systems financially collapse bob rae the second least popular man in ontario warned ontarians a few years ago that if they didn t stop cross border shopping in such huge numbers the services they expect from the province just won t be there in a few years fortunately for them and less fortunately for the retailers here in western new york the canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value he didn t say so but i knew he meant the ohip what would happen if his warning turned out to be the truth would the private insurers take up the slack they d be under no obligation to of course they could eventually make money again but if what you say is true they d be loathe to do so and out of practice in handling such basic services too wouldn t free care encourage people to run to the doctor for every ache and pain people who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospital about a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical bills still canadians who pay nothing at the doctor s have a lower per person health bill than we do it is free in that there are no deductibles nor copayments two things which i advocate to make the canadian insurance look more like real health insurance which actually it is i know that when working in alberta ontario and quebec i was aware that i was paying for health insurance e g in toronto ohip fees were listed on my pay stub manitoba did not collect at paycheque time but only annually at income tax time built into the tax rate only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it s free along with the canadian left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda would that it were free americans would start another revolution if they had to pay taxes at canadian rates isn t the private health insurance industry just too big and powerful to kill dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be politically thorny in the quiet words of one advocate for a national plan some firms now sell more than billion in health insurance they d put up a hard fight not only has the industry grown eightfold since canada shut down its own health insurers but our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does canada s parliamentary system health insurance does exist in canada and in western europe its just that it doesn t cover basic care you can opt out in canada and germany but you ll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so i e no market when private insurance realized how much money they d make without the risks involved in basic insurance e g neurosurgery versus deluxe amenities e g having to call granada tv to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone s private hospital room they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility in quebec last spring a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine low cost parts of that province s public health insurance plan again i doubt americans would like giving the insurance companies that much power i half wonder if the canadian health insurers didn t go along with the provinces and the federal government years ago because they knew that there was a good chance of the public system going bust in the long run and then afterwards they could clean up okay this sort of contradicts what i said higher up but it s another possibility they d have an added bonus when arguing against government involvement in their industry

is the main engine of social instability in this context we ll put aside religious turmoil mass migrations etc well the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to social and political instability while economic inequality is much more strongly related in virtually all major revolutions including england the puritan revolution france russia and china the revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term growth and poverty was declining what sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible if poverty were the main engine of social instability this typical historical pattern would not hold in fact revolutions would have been far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time much deleted gee jim if you ll check the constitution you ll find in order to promote the general welfare do ordain and establish this constitution i m surprised you missed it it s right there in the first paragraph i would have thought you would have made it at least through the preamble you almost got it right and it was a good try but you should follow your own advice the preamble to the constitution does read as you have quoted but let us not forget that after all it is only the preamble it is not a binding part of the constitution and carries no weight in the law that poor tortured paragraph has got to be one of the most unfortunate passages in the english language witness the legions of blowhards like yourself who think those

sorry buddy but some other blowhards managed to include the general welfare in another portion of the constitution article i section the congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states i guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they said in the preamble just to make sure you ve got the point let s do a little experiment what if the constitution read as follows preamble we the people to promote the general welfare do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america constitution the federal government shall have one function and one function only to provide for the defense of the nation but as noted above the constitution doesn t say that

see this as a problem with libertarianism that it cannot be stable that might be true but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se if a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again we would just be back where we are now this is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where

significantly since then at the same time health care costs have increased more than any period in history as far as defensive medicine is concerned the ama estimates that its total impact is about billion per year that s about of the total current increase in health care costs and the estimate is from a group that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine on health

spectator this is taken from page ah someone had mentioned this journal but gave no further information but the most bizarre incident is alleged to have happened in the school year at oral roberts university according to a sworn affidavit dated october and filed with the senate judiciary committee in which lawrence shiles now a lawyer in tulsa recounted the following shortly after the class had begun professor hill gave us a written assignment which i completed and duly turned in when this assignment was passed out to the class after having been marked by the professor sitting next to me were fellow students jeffrey londoff and mark stewart upon opening the assignments and reviewing our grades and comments made by anita hill i found ten to twelve short black pubic hairs in the pages of my assignment i glanced over at jeff londoff s assignment and saw similar pubic hairs in his work at the time i made the statement to londoff that either she had a low opinion of our work or she had graded our assignment in the bathroom mark stewart overheard the conversation and said that he had similar pubic hairs in his assignment also this became the standing joke among many students for the remainder of the year in classes other students in that class confirmed the story londoff says he couldn t be certain that the hairs were pubic but he said he thought it was unlikely that they could have come from hill s head since they were short coarse and curly and hill had had the hair on her head straightened another student who saw the hair but did not want to be identified said of its origins you just know when you see it does this satisfy you yes thank you though i am really curious as to why this never came out at least not in what i saw up here in canada or on cnn which is sent up here during the thomas nomination hearings surely one would think that her claim to having been sexually harassed would have a great deal less credibility if it could be shown that she had herself been guilty of it or do you regard sworn statements given to a u s senate committee as equivalent to toilet paper ahemmm it depends for instance if it were the sworn statements at the warren

regulations that favor auto dealers but what i hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents terms to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws and a desire to eliminate legislator s pay each strikes me as a particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special interests cannot influence public policy in fact they seem clearly designed to accomplish the opposite if government is not allowed to use non initiated force to achieve its goals than no special interest can influence the government to use non initiated force on their behalf fine libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion the notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious consideration is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists for example does non initiated force coercion include tax collection does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by adam smith since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state how is the state to deal with it exclusively through after the fact arbitration legal compulsion the means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic which i ll address briefly it certainly won t happen until libertarianism is the dominate philosophy what means do we have to make libertarianism the dominate philosophy statists run the education monopoly so we have to be creative the advocates for self government reports of their seminar participants embrace libertarianism that s the best means i ve seen yet we should lobby for compulsory seminar attendance in jest well i must admit that the picture of libertarians as amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a complex conflictual industrial society i d venture to point out however that if libertarians couldn t convince at least of a group of seminar participants to embrace their philosophy their propaganda skills need to be honed frankly however it is no great trick to create a government for a society in which almost everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy once that is assumed all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with elections police etc and as mr marx said the state will just wither away on the way there however would you like to explain how eliminating virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the current society will help

especially if your site is a university do you know any person who believes that a university endorses every comment made from a university site that is why i refered specifically to a company good now do you know any person who believes that a company endorses every comment made from a university site you are extrapolating from the statement i made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the teel case if you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather better the mode of argument i was using was a form of rhetoric argument by example i describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply thus the action is not permisable obviously a company posting from a university adress would be squashed it would be contrary to the internet comercial use usenet does not distribute letterhead organization desydeutsches elektronen

members of my family sigh if you are implying that i am lying i suggest you read mark holohan and ulick staffords posts into soc culture british if you are suggesting that advocating murder is a trivial matter i would prefer that you state it directly certainly i oppose the right of dr sidiqui and the ayatolah khomenhi to call for the murder of salman rushdie incitement to murder is not part of what i consider legitimate freedom of speech as for your notion that employees can argue their different political views at their own expense could you explain precisely what expense you re talking about internet is not free the connection charges are quite expensive for comercial concerns could you give me a cost breakdown for the expense to your company attributable to an employee s posting a political view in disagreement with yours numbers please that is irrelevant the case is not the incremental cost but the facility cost if i decide that a company i am associated with should subscribe to usenet that usenet connection is the property of the company it is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy for example if a microsoft employee were to post windows nt is crap don t buy it from a microsoft machine i would consider it reasonable for microsoft to sack that employee in the same way if a company decides that it has political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner this is no worse than rupert murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his views i was refering to the arrogance of your position quoting the words written by slave owners at me in the cause of freedom which words written by slave owners did i quote i don t recall quoting anyone ah yes you did not quote them merely refered to them your constitution is not considered sacrosanct in other parts of the globe nor have i assumed it is i don t consider the first amendment to have talismanic value you might just as well have attempted to argue from the king james bible to a muslim i was pointing out that your reasoning is parochial when with little effort you could have made a substantive point i made the effort apparently you made a certain effort to misunderstand me your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment your signature and pretty well damn all else for an example of a uk publication that understands this try index on censorship i used to subscribe i would still if i was not moving index regularly publishes opinions by non americans who believe the first amendment represents appropriate free speech principles for all open societies see e g the opinions of the dissenting law lords in the spycatcher case are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case the initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harmed would be grounds for prior restraint the second set of hearings on the substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already the part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third parties the first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the us proves the crux of the spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of british law the censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government s ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book you haven t any reason to believe that anything i ve said has been reached unquestioningly only most of what you write for someone who purports to be opposed to argument from assertion you certainly get by on assertions a lot funny i saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made of course in rejecting an assertion i have to make a contrary assertion since this assertion is unprovable i left it at that so far i have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your own you are attacking my anti censorship view because i dare to accept the validity of some pro censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions plus i am not an absolutist i have this funny idea that the solution to this problem was not decided in by a group of white male gentry in secret session and sumarized in a single line furthermore i don t think that the issues are half as simple as you imply you may think that i am being anti american in disallowing recourse to the first ammendment it s just that this argument has no currency in the parts of the world where there is state censorship such as iran kewait and israel i don t pretend to have geared my

every day that socialism may not even survive the turn of the century ed of course has never demonstrated remarkable knowlege of socialism or any other political system come to that while the swedes have already discarded their third way and the french have made history by turning out the socialist party in a record setting defeat it is italy that appears most precariously on the edge of its political existence that leaves germany japan and the uk as examples of a country where the right wing government is on the verge of collapse oh and of course the usa which just elected a socialist government italy today is a basket case even by european standards it has introduced new taxes in months and public sector revenue is at or near the of gdp mark etc unfortunately you can t pin this on the left or the right both are to blame both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal the only untained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalist separatists and the communist party which has collapsed in spite of this political gluteny it has an annual deficit exceeding the sum of all other ec countries and a public debt times that of latin america italy is understandably having serious trouble selling its treasury bonds in the markets and while italy is an extreme case it is anything but unique all european governments appear headed in the same direction in spite of their nominally non socialist governments unfortunately europeans being well europeans it is very unlikely that they will discover american style liberty instead they will likely lurch from socialism to fascism as quickly as they had moved from fascism to socialism never pausing along the way to reasseses the role of government itself i hope i am wrong ed should take a look at the budget deficit regan and bush created together before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget deficits here none of them are serious on the usa scale and here in europe we have zero interest in ed ipser type freed thank you we do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers for the benefit of the super wealthy we are quite happy with social democracy and despite the fuss made in time and newsweek there is remarkably little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by socialism the problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education and health care and provision of the welfare state this has been achieved across the whole of europe only the usa is struggling to catch up the problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded nobody ever claimed that the collapse of socialism would be pretty the decline of the nation state will probably lead first to anarchy since politicians always cut essential services before pork los angeles has rampant crime and frantically waits for the next wave of riots but it has a spanking new subway that nobody wants to use and which like every

presumably he thinks that it is in europe on the other hand he most probably hasn t heard of a european city thus does the world hurtle toward chaos even as the st century approaches rather the opposite what is happening in italy is that the communist party has collapsed this has meant that the grand coalition between right and left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed the magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and corruption and have arrested half the politicians the fact that the socialists are in charge this week is incidental the

nigel allen writes here is a press release from the united states information agency digest of foreign media reaction from the united states information agency april of to national desk contact anne chermak of the united states information agency washington april following is part one of a digest of foreign media reaction from april compiled by the united states information agency terrorism and world insecurity in recent editorials iran was universally recognized as te source of the double threat of state sponsored terrorism and islamic extremism but beyond this fear and condemnation journalists found little common ground that would compel both north and south and arab and non arab nations to work together to combat the global threat of terrorism for example egyptian and algerian papers were in the forefront in charging u s complicity in the current instability in the middle east those commentators asserted that the united states had promoted islamic fundamentalism during the afghanistan war and had further added to regional instability by alternately encouraging iraq and iran the cads the fact that this is precisely what the us was up to of course is not mentioned it is a fact that regan and bush sold arms to iran it is also a fact that they supported and armed iraq still this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing india s papers weighed the pros and cons of helping the west to identify pakistan s role in promoting terrorism noting on the one hand that doing so could bring ruination to islamabad s kashmir cause but on the other could also bring india s security apparatus uncomfortably close to the cia and the mossad arab papers continued to portray iraq and libya as being unfairly treated by the un while israel remains unpunished for resolutions which it has violated in the case of lybia there is the problem that the us only decided that gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with damascus during the gulf war one day the us is certain that its syria the next lybia for a strange reason the us will not provide evidence to lybian courts for extradition proceedings faced with similar demands the usa would reject them as would any other country concerning northern ireland president clinton s message of consolation to the victims of the warrington bombing was seen in british tabloids as signalling a tougher stance by the american government against violence by the ira the word is terrorism the problem is that after the behaviour of george bush the usa has an image abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests then comming out with a dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a fitting combination of the words freedom dignity democaracy or of terrorism dictatorship etc as appropriate the usa could go quite far to mend the bridges with iran the people there are rather pissed off because the usa first supported the shah who they loathed and then supported saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but iran is meant to be the country run by unreasonable bigots not the usa so if there is to be movement it would be easier for the usa to move first off they could recognise iraqu s responsibility in initiating the iran iraq war providing technical assistance to iran to get it s oil production back up to capacity would also be a smart move at the moment iran is above it s opec ceiling if they had extra capacity they would use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests the iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating they also need western technology phill hallam baker\n", "label": "politics"}, {"text": "re temper tantrums

anyone daevid bornhuetter machen the madison edge the main difference between adolf hitler and rush limbaugh is that hitler was original and showed initiative mort sahl on the tom snyder radio show abc radio network october although i find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale of mr limbaugh i find him entertaining and i often agree with his conclusions the fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining nlns believe it or not i was planning this comparative review of mein kampf and limbaugh s transcribed rant the way things ought to be before sahl issued his comparative review as usual sahl s was independent and sharp as a scalpel my effort can only dream of comparing favorably to mort s at least it has a fairly popular orginating premise everyone i d mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the acts of those false prophets both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions in fact limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over million almost identical to the number of votes cast for hitler in the april german election both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt actually i find limbaugh s oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking even though his conclusions are often correct i would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the right things where right is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement is showing an acute case of myopic social perspective not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity limbaugh is certainly far from perfect but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the citizenry and for the elimination of local control over affairs public perhaps limbaugh has a following because the people are tired of being treated like errant children by a self important group of arrogant controlling myopic people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the oughta be s inside their own hopelessly closed minds the last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books hitler s example is when on page he claims the german nationalist terrorist leo schlageter he bombed part of a railway line between dusseldorf and duisburg being caught in the act in was betrayed to france by a representative of his government when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement in fact the governments of both the reich and prussia as well as the vatican actively intervened to save him from execution and almost succeeded ok let us take your word for that and work with it a nice specific incident limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places god is unconstitutional of course it s not god but the official imposition of particular concepts of god against an individual s will that s unconstitutional but limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that hmmm congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof liberal translation the federal government as long as it is run by liberals may force local school districts to include certain iconic content in christmas displays while prohibiting others i think limbaugh has you on this one it seems to me that he is arguing for less imposition of the federal government into religion nice job on the specificity of that one too analysis of historical modern communication media deleted but as mort sahl also observed on the radio the other night some cloutmeister of the radical right wants limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda and remember sahl is an al haig conservative these days mort might not know exactly who rush s equivalent of rodolf hess is the book itself suggests ed mclaughlin the former president of abc radio and now limbaugh s partner in efm media the radio program s production company but mort himself is a veteran of the talk show having hosted them in new york washington and los angeles he knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men he knows that limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as al capone did it s almost worthy of a rico indictment ah yes it is a conspiracy of profound proportions methinks that you may be a bit resentful of mr limbaugh s success because you attribute it primarily to luck how after all could anyone with profound differences of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of conspiracy or blind luck do you feel this same level of knee jerk resentment against lottery winners or do you congratulate them on their good fortune on questions of social issues there is an overabundance of material in the limbaugh book that seems to echo hitler s venom for example this should be great fun since it is the liberal movement in america that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of the people and business government business partnership indeed and mr limbaugh is the populist nemesis of that movement i have read mr limbaugh s book and although it was not the most literary piece i have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain venom at all let alone venom comparable to an individual who callously murdered millions out of racism on their own qualifications to control society hitler out of the host of sometimes millions of people who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth partly perhaps understand it one man author s emphasis must step forward in order to form with apodeictic force out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses granite principles and to take up the fight for their sole correctness until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises page a very serious tone in that oratory limbaugh who needs the media when they ve got me the show is devoted exclusively to what i think the phrase with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even denotes the egress of mental aptitude i require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me it might take four or five years but i m convinced the media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking kicking and screaming all the way pages and respectively you neglect to mention that mr limbaugh have you ever listened to his show btw continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon himself included you yourself mention that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions he also adopts a rather satirical approach and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness and he says as much this is in contrast to the average mass media show in which the audience is treated as society s intellectual lowest common denominator i am sure that adolf hitler was a master of satire i am sure he was just kidding when he said that the jews were the cause of germany s problems and needed to be exterminated on religion as the basis of a nation hitler in this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the aryan his dying off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture he who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the lord sins against the benevolent creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from paradise page this is not religion it is clearly a perverse worship of race since christ was a jew it seems quite unlikely that hitler s characterization of the aryan as the highest image of the lord fits with christian doctrine limbaugh america was founded as a judeo christian country but our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion people for whom belief in god is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years is it only a coincidence that the quality of american education has declined ever since pages private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools american history is indeed primarily judeo christian i suppose that mr limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to adolf hitler worshiping the aryan race i think you might be reaching just a wee bit here on popular culture as a reason for social collapse hitler the fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in one has only to look at the menus of our movie houses vaudevilles and theatres and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food theatre art literature movies the press billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of state and culture pages and definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here limbaugh today hollywood is in trouble the reason is that hollywood has forgotten who its audience is they make fun of people who believe in god they ridicule the traditional family heterosexuality and monagamy they disparage american heroes page just a guess here but i don t think that mr limbaugh would advocate government control of hollywood you should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this i believe this is more a criticism of hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses not an advocation of government control of hollywood s liberals on the other hand want to have complete government control of our school systems so that the government can teach the people at an early age the right way to view religion and morality i believe mr limbaugh is against this as his satirical use of the young heads full of mush hyperbole indicates on the news meida hitler the activity of the so called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the german people and the german reich one can pass by in silence the marxist papers of lies it s task is only to break the people s folkish and national spine in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters the jews page pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy limbaugh elements of the media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes the cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes during the gulf war cnn correspondent bernard shaw said cnn is a global network we can t take sides cant take sides if they don t realize that their freedom lies in the united states of america and that therefore they should defend this nation they are hopelessly misguided and may i suggest flirting with megalomania pages and indication here that elements of the media since career is a self selected categorization perhaps an inferred larger percentage than represented in the populace at large has a leftist bias doesn t sound too unreasonable no insinuation that cnn should not report in an objective fashion only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal you may disagree and it may well be exagerrated but it is not an unreasonable opinion and mr limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his audience knows that these are his opinions unlike most other reporting that purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree or other in a statistical sense reflect the biases of the reporters who is being disingenuous here mr shaw or mr limbaugh again you should ask mr limbaugh himself but i expect that he would oppose government control of the media to continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading it is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome liberal arrogance liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them why don t you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind not the real world after putting these books down there is one undeniable fact that haunts me in the s adolf hitler fed depressed and frightened germans the opiate of hatred of those around them in turn it allowed germans to hand their collective national power to the nazis in the s rush limbaugh is doing the very same thing distributing hatred to depressed and frightened americans in turn it is helping the american radical right to maintain its power base as the year nightmare of the reagan bush era comes to an end hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for the fascist states of america perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve rush limbaugh as a hate monger but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self importance of the left not hatred as to mr bush you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings mr reagan on the other hand did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business mr clinton is increasing fascism in america through business government partnership and increased levels of taxation perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school and if limbaugh is not as repellant a hitler it is only because the radical right utilizes limbaugh as its own gateway opiate one can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook america on hmmm seems to me that limbaugh is not in any way comparable to hitler because he has not murdered six million jews and many many others out of racism i come from a mixed race family so i am quite well attuned to racism i don t hear any coming from rush limbaugh the only place i hear racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the liberal left the liberal left is the movement i see trying to get america hooked on the opiates of socialized medicine socialized transportation socialized education etc the left already has america hopelessly addicted to that liberal drug the social security chain letter it is quite clear to me that while the hitler analogy does not really apply to either rush limbaugh or william jefferson clinton if one of the two is closer than the other it is clearly the fascist clinton the madison edge can be reached at po box madison wi this is the same address as idiots anonymous isn t it matt freivald

not everyone is a long term investor one might find oneself as i did in late anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings given the choice between waiting a few weeks and taking an extra tax hit or selling in december with preferential tax treatment only a fool would choose the former the fact that brett can now construct post hoc calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point there was plenty of money style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late to sell now and save on taxes in case anyone missed

the report is the first order of business it s high on the agenda on something that they ll discuss i think the president and general vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to vietnam today

ms myers they re continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs package q is it your impression that senator dole is in any way flexible on this ms myers well i think we re hopeful that we re going to get some kind of jobs package through the senate and we ll continue to work with senator dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement q did they discuss the vat tax ms myers i don t know if that came up q can you check that ms myers sure q so what are they is the president offering to scale down his program is that what he s trying to do buy it down to where dole will sign on ms myers well he s trying to protect as much of it as he can but it s important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the senate and through congress now and as soon as we reach some conclusions on that we ll let you know but at the moment he s continuing to consult with members of congress including obviously senator dole q is he talking to anybody else ms myers i don t believe he talked to any other republicans yesterday q is he talking to anybody today ms myers i don t think anything is scheduled but i wouldn t rule it out q we were led to believe that the president called mr dole on the subject of russian aid and that bob dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package is that correct ms myers i think the president has contacted several people on russian aid i think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with senator dole the primary objective of the conversation was russian aid that was the first order of business but it was both q in the president s mind are they linked politically in that if the republicans continue to reject the stimulus package he thinks it will be harder to sell russian aid to the american people has he made that argument ms myers i can t talk about specifically what arguments he might have made the president is obviously committed to both he liked to see a jobs package to the american people first but as you know we outlined the details of additional russian aid last night in tokyo q but does the president believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade americans to vote for russian to accept a vote for russian aid ms myers i think that the president is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package to pass a jobs package and we re still hopeful that we ll get some kind of jobs package through the congress q is it fair to say that the president is negotiating now with dole ms myers he s discussing options with him q on the stimulus is it your understanding that over the break some democrats themselves have left the support that they had earlier for the package the stimulus package ms myers i think we still have wide support in the senate for the jobs package q but specifically that you ve lost democrats other than shelby ms myers i don t believe so there hasn t been a vote q what about kohl q kohl and feingold ms myers there hasn t been a vote yet and we ll continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote because we believe that a majority of the members of the united states senate support the package q if you re weren t worried about kohl and feingold why did george mention milwaukee projects the other day ms myers i think george pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded or to lose funding if this jobs package doesn t pass q no democrats laughter ms myers i ll let you draw your own conclusions q does he plan to talk to dole again today or any other republicans again today ms myers there s nothing specifically scheduled but again i wouldn t rule it out q does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today ms myers what we ve done is we re in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state i think it s entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up we ll send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package q will you share those with us ms myers sure as we did yesterday q do you have copies of the ones you sent ms myers yes we made those available yesterday and we certainly can continue to provide them today q dee dee since yesterday s questions and subsequent stories about the vat what further consideration of this issue has been given ms myers nothing s changed since yesterday i think the president commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on and i don t think we have anything to add to that q but he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it can you tell us ms myers i think that there has been i m not going to speculate on who supports it i think the president said that there has been some support among business and labor groups i don t think he said he was directly contacted by them q are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this ms myers i think there s been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently but i don t think i want to add to that q in february though the president said that this was something to be considered or years down the road what has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind ms myers i think as we said yesterday it is something that the working groups are looking at they re considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the president s health care plan the president has not taken it up yet has not made a decision on it and beyond that i don t have anything to add q you haven t answered the question it wasn t being considered by anyone in the white house after the president s comments in february and george reaffirmed that in a briefing q and then suddenly q what happened ms myers the working groups as we have said throughout we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across the board and one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value added tax q but the president himself took this off the table dee dee and suddenly it reappears and this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way what has happened in the meantime ms myers the president has not looked at this it hasn t been presented to him again yet the working groups are looking at it as they re looking at a wide variety of options and no decisions have been made q and it raises the question of how independently the task force is working ms myers the task force was instructed to consider all options and they ve taken that mandate seriously and they re considering all options q but that s not the impression that the president left in february the impression he left was that this was something that was long range to be looked at years down the road the clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table not an option q if it changes i ll tell you q bring him on q and you repeatedly referred to the president s remarks telling us that those were still in operation ms myers it s changed and we told you laughter q but that s what alice rivlin s comments and donna shalala comments were about i mean that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent cabinet officers ms myers i wouldn t no alice rivlin s not a cabinet member first of all second of all it was not orchestrated but clearly they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it s something that s being looked at we confirmed that yesterday and i don t have anything to add to that q is it because he has very few options q is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the president about in other words has the president himself personally ruled it out and it s now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table or is it in fact back on the table having been placed there by discussions with the president ms myers it is not the working group s mission at this point to convince the president of anything it is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options i think that they will certainly present the vat to him in that context and at this point he s not that presentation has not been made but it s something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on q they will present it to him as one of his options though he specifically ruled it out ms myers correct q dee dee is this more than a trial balloon is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation ms myers it s simply a statement of fact the working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care reform one of the options that they re looking at is the vat q dee dee when the working groups were examining this possibility was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not ms myers i don t know what the specific timing of their drafting of options is i don t know q who was telling you that it was not under consideration ms myers i was referring back to the president s comments q have they discovered that the sin taxes won t raise enough money to fund the core benefit package ms myers no there s no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care plan q i m asking whether the projections ms myers there s a number of options depending on how the plan is structured you can t decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like and so you can t discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you know q dee dee we ve been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible packages ms myers correct q the question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package that is not a very difficult computation ms myers it is a question that you know that we re not going to answer until there s a number of options being considered it depends on how the package is structured the exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made q and when the president has been meeting with health care his health care advisors which we are told he has been doing ms myers correct q they have never once said to him these are your funding options including the vat he has never heard the word vat in his ms myers i am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily they re not daily but the quasi regular briefings q well you have ms myers i have not other than to say that he s not considered the vat and i think that is a true statement q no but you said that it has not been presented to him as an option ms myers correct q that doesn t mean he hasn t heard about it ms myers i m not going to get into the details of what s discussed i think that statement stands for itself q specific dee dee when you say he hasn t looked at it do you mean that he hasn t looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage or hasn t looked at it in general because back in chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works what the advantages are the whole thing it sounds like ms myers but that was i think in chilicothe if you go back to his remarks there it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure and i think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan but clearly it s something that he s thought about in the broad context i mean that was clear in chilicothe what i m saying is that in the process of the working groups it s something that he hasn t considered yet it s something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options and that no decisions have been made and i m not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being discussed q it s your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place you say that no option that the option has not been presented to him ms myers that is correct q do you stand by does the white house still stand by george s statement in march that this will not be in the proposal ms myers no decisions have been made we have nothing to add to what s already been said q let me follow up here do you stand by what rivlin said yesterday that if any kind of vat were to be used or considered that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive ms myers i m not going to comment any further on what might happen if q but do you stand by the previous conversations in february that if there were to be a vat i think the president said you d exclude food and energy ms myers i m not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that hasn t been made q was the president aware prior to donna shalala s comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups ms myers i don t know specifically what q could you check for us because that s a real important credibility question ms myers sure q since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed at the beginning and throughout as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money were you all kept in the dark was the press office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you ve been denying that a vat tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option ms myers i think we ve said all that we have to say it is something the working groups are looking at the president has not made a decision about it yet and beyond that i have nothing to add q well sorry dee dee there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here yours primarily what we re asking is if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not or if it s a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading us ms myers i don t believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium ever ever q has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something has anybody told anybody to come out ms myers we re not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead anybody i ve said what i have to say about this issue q all we were trying to find out ms myers i understand what you re trying to find out and i ve given you the answers helen q we re trying to find out what changed what made it an option again that s the ms myers the working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options and they are doing that q yes but it wasn t an option before how can you investigate it if the president has taken it off the table ms myers it is something that they re obviously considering and the president has not made a decision on q yes but he took it off the table in february ms myers working groups are considering it they ll present it to the president at some point and he ll make a decision q why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table ms myers it s clearly on the table q yes but he took it off the table did he change his mind ms myers it s back on the table bill q did he change his mind ms myers he said this morning that he hasn t made a decision about it he obviously knows that it s on the table it s something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we ll let you know q so he must have changed his mind right ms myers at some point it will be looked at i mean q dee dee there s like two options either he changed his mind or the working groups think they re authority exceeds the president s ms myers the working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options they ve done that q are you going to put out his income tax ms myers yes there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon his return will be available q will there be any kind of briefing to go through it ms myers no nothing s planned i think someone will be available probably not in a briefing setting but to walk you through the questions q we re used to be walked line by line through the presidential tax forms ms myers i ve seen those briefings laughter q could we have one ms myers no i don t think there will be any kind of a formal briefing but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about it q did they file a joint form ms myers yes q when did he file it ms myers i believe it s being filed today q dee dee is there going to be a backgrounder for miyazawa ms myers no there will be a readout after the meeting q no backgrounder today ms myers no backgrounder today q this is complicated stuff we need help laughter ms myers we can t give you taxes and miyazawa all in one day it s too confusing laughter q vance and owen have opened the doors on the use of force in bosnia they ve both said that a they never ruled it out and b it might be necessary now does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach ms myers there s been no change in our policy towards bosnia we have always said that we d consider q but does that impact upon your decision are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you ms myers they re people whose opinions carry weight certainly i mean the president supports the process that they ve initiated but there s been no change in our policy for bosnia although we re considering a number of options right now if the serbs don t come back to the negotiating table if they don t sign on to some kind of an agreement we will consider additional options which we ve been saying regularly q one follow up question then we cannot get a straight answer from anyone in the administration why do you not set a deadline for the serbs can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table ms myers we re continuing to put pressure on them every day q which doesn t work so ms myers well we think it is having some effect we re going to continue to tighten sanctions as you know we support the omnibus resolution we expect that to come to a vote on the th q you say it s having an effect can you give us any documentation ms myers i d be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that q there s been no you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in bosnia serbia yes in bosnia no ms myers i think that they ve had effect in serbia and we think they ve had some effect in bosnia and again i ll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that if you d like q we would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in bosnia we had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in belgrade but we haven t seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting can you provide something along those lines ms myers i will see what i can get you q on the extra russian aid that christopher announced this morning where is that money coming from ms myers we ll have to work with congress on the details of that package q so that would be new money that you would hope to get ms myers yes that s new money in addition to the billion announced in vancouver so i assume that you all have seen the billion package that was announced this morning in tokyo by secretary christopher q isn t there a concern though about offering something which you have to get in congress i mean that was the concern with vancouver you didn t want to do that ms myers the concern with vancouver was to do something immediately which required money that was already approved in the fiscal budget what we re looking at now is a little bit longer term plan to build on top of the billion that we announced in vancouver this clearly will require congressional approval or some of it will anyway and we re going to continue to work with congress to make that happen q to what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by congress ms myers the president has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves forward q was christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through congress ms myers it was created in consultation with congress q in meeting with the law enforcement officials is that does that have a set speech and a goal a direction ms myers yes the president will talk about and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the president s jobs package they believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to do q who are they ms myers it s members or leadership from three organizations napo which is the national association of police organizations ibpo which is the international brotherhood of police organizations i believe and iupa which is the international union of police associations q will the fbi chief be there ms myers the fbi chief no q or any other federal law enforcement officials ms myers no it will be the president and these national law enforcement organization leaders q does the billion announced today include the million that s in the fy budget for disarmament ms myers no the nunn lugar money is separate q so this would be the million that s in the budget already plus another billion ms myers i believe all of this is on top of the million already in the budget q is this going to be part of the supplemental or fiscal ms myers we ll work with congress on the exact funding mechanism on exactly how this will be paid for q this billion on top of ms myers on top of million on top of the million nunn lugar money we announced earlier q and this is what prompted the president to call bob dole it was on this tranche not on the previous money he was calling bob dole ms myers correct q is there a briefing on miyazawa ms myers there will be a readout after the meeting with miyazawa tomorrow q dee dee on a totally unrelated matter some republicans who are active in the u s chamber of commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the white house and the chamber of commerce there are the town hall meeting the other night the satellite and all of this relationship does the white house feel that you re getting too close to these chambers of commerce ms myers that s an interesting charge laughter after how many years of democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the chambers now there are those who would accuse us of being too close i think that s interesting but no we re thrilled by the support we ve received from the national chamber and local chambers across the country and we ll continue to work with them on this and other initiatives q what s the status of the president thinking about going to this democratic retreat ms myers it s on his calendar i think he ll almost certainly go q all three days ms myers we haven t figured out exactly when he ll be there yet q is it open to coverage ms myers no i believe the whole thing is closed q is he going to have any kind of address statement anything at all on the gay rights march on the th ms myers we re still looking at that we haven t made a final decision about how we ll who will make a statement or what q any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders ms myers nothing is scheduled but i wouldn t rule it out q what about an aids czar ms myers it s coming q anything on the weekend q there s been a suggestion that he s going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights march ms myers no i think this is something he s been discussing for a long time appearing at the senate democratic retreat q the weekend ms myers weekend don t know the only thing on right now is the radio address on saturday q any travel plans ms myers if it changes none right now q he s not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package ms myers no specific plans right now q what about mid week anything likely ms myers it s possible yes i think it s likely that we ll travel next week certainly the weekend q has he called thurmond about his daughter ms myers i don t know i ll check q going to name a drug czar this weekend ms myers this weekend i don t believe so q and the radio address on saturday is that going to be focused on the stimulus package ms myers i m sure it will the press thank you end a m edt\n", "label": "politics"}, {"text": "clinton vp gore joins students in orlando for st kids earth summit

secretary for immediate release april remarks by the president to law enforcement organizations the rose garden p m edt the president good afternoon ladies and gentlemen two months ago i presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the american people their jobs and their economic future the federal budget plan passed congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country then the short term jobs plan i presented to congress which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the house of representatives two weeks ago it now has the support of a majority of the united states senate all of these members of congress know it s time to get the economy moving again to get job growth going again to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity unfortunately a minority of the members of the united states senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs bill when congress returns i ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at stake the issue is not politics it s people sixteen million of them are looking for full time jobs and can t find them these men and women don t care about who s up or down in washington they care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day s work and supporting their families and drawing a paycheck they re asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward i am prepared to do that and i have been working with the senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs plan i m willing to compromise so long as we keep the focus on jobs keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs our opponents have been asking for a smaller package today i ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the american people but even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller i believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of americans and one in particular and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime so i will ask even in this reduced package for an additional million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national recession together with a matching effort by local governments this could put as many as police officers back on the job and back on the beat in communities all across our nation at a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments america can make and i ask both houses of congress to make that investment in our people s safety and in their piece of mind i believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs make no mistake about it i will fight for these priorities as hard as i ever have i will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs their future and for fundamental change i want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that i had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police officers they came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the package and i want them to be free to talk about that they came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful future i say what i say today not just because it s good for law enforcement but because it s good for the people who live in these communities i have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they re hired to protect it reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time these are the kinds of things that we are trying to do i promised in my campaign that i d do everything i could to put another police officers on the street over the next four years this makes a good downpayment on that this keeps in mind the core of the jobs package and this will help us to move forward so i ask the people in the senate who have blocked the jobs bill let s work together i can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe streets i do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting prosperity for our people i have done my part now to end the gridlock i ask you to do yours i want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the american people beginning with janet reno the distinguished attorney general q mr president can you tell us do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a vat tax at this point in the congressional dialogue the president not at all i think it should have they wouldn t have any relationship one to the other first of all i made absolutely no decision on that you should know that there s a lot of support in the business community and the labor community people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this economy but i have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax q do you personally believe that the american public is ready to pay for to have another tax to pay for health care i mean apart from what business and labor leaders have said the president i m not going to speculate on that i will say this the real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the cost i mean that is everyone knows that if you do what we re proposing to do if you streamline the insurance system if you fix the system so that there s no longer an enormous economic incentive to over utilize or over provide certain services if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it isn t now every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care system the real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security i have no idea the polls say that but i don t know all i know is the polls that i see in the press that many of you have commissioned they say overwhelmingly the american people want the security of an affordable health care system but i don t think that has anything to do with this stimulus and it certainly shouldn t have people want a job first and foremost they want that more than anything else q now that you ve announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable i assume summer jobs is one the president i want the summer jobs i want the highway program and i want the police program i still intend let me say this i still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill which did not pass the congress last year this is a supplement to that not a substitute for it in any way but i think we need to do that i think we need the ryan white funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with aids and there are several other things that i think should be done we have to do the agriculture department meat inspectors the safety of the public depends on that there are a number of other things that i don t i don t think any of it should be cut but i have given senator mitchell and senator byrd i talked to them and senator dole called me yesterday to discuss this and i told him that i would call him back i called him back last night in new hampshire and we discussed this and i basically asked them to talk today and said that i would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord so i don t want to be any more specific than i have been already and let s see if they can talk it out q when you talked to senator dole and senator mitchell did you tell them about your increase also that million that you want that as part of the package the president i did i told senator i left word for senator mitchell last night about it when i talked to senator dole i don t remember for sure i do not believe i mentioned it but i did tell him that i was prepared to reduce the package and i wanted to break the gridlock and i told him that i was working on a reformulation of it so that in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that i thought the american people wanted us to address and this is certainly consistent with that thank you end p m edt\n",

on the news last night clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling his so called stimulus package it seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free immunizations for poor kids immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to go have it done the problem is not the cost it is the irresponible parents who are to stupid or to lazy to have it done in case you haven t noticed clintonites are pushing a universal health care access program access here means that folks who do not give a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services delivered to their doorsteps excuse me for sticking my nose in but any parent parents who do not allready immunize their children especially if it is already free don t deserve one

economy has had its ups and downs through a number of prevailing economic philosophies but then economics is hardly a science in my lifetime your philosophy socialism masquerading as a liberal welfare state has been in ascendancy no i mean exactly what i wrote the welfare system of the new deal is wholly inadequate to cope with the current state of affairs absolutely so the response of socialists is take us even further into socialism whether or not the fathers work is not germane to single mothers very true but the promotion of casual sexuality is something that plays a part in the single mother problem i ll buy that and there s lots of reasons for it extremely far down on the list being the flash in the pan media attention a bunch of middle class dropouts got for their philosophy and experimentation flash in the pan no your subculture has utterly dominated the tv and movie industries for two decades now my subculture my we re getting personal the only subculture i see dominating the tv and movie industries is money if you ll buy it they ll sell it and as recent movements to boycott tv advertisers have shown they re very sensitive about what sells whatever happened to personal responsibility anyway or am i personally responsible for the decline in that too to the extent that people have been encouraged to not be responsible for themselves yes come on you and i both know that the major problem of this society today isn t a lack of employment it s a lack of people willing to work huh tell that to the single mother i know who was laid off from her hour job at a hospital and now works full time minimum wage jobs to barely be able to support herself and her kid barely hey she s too proud to go on public assistance but the only jobs she can find are menial and with no benefits and no career path either they find excuses to lay people off and hire new ones rather than give raises and perks and why not it s a lot cheaper oddly enough all the unskilled or semiskilled people i know manage to find employment almost immediately maybe she needs to move to a cheaper part of the country where jobs are plentiful and the cost of living is lower the west side of chicago is about as cheap as it gets squalor city tell me about all these places where it s cheap to live and jobs are abundant i ll pass them on sonoma county you live in a strange and wondrous place sir

at least not dissuade them no it s that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists all the spoiled rich kids feeling guilty about their wealth but not guilty enough to give it away they just look for politicians to take my more limited wealth away i see a lot of people willing nay eager to work what i don t see is a system that makes it at all feasible to do so it s not just welfare which

american right wing and what they called pinko organizations representatives of the anti defamation league a well known organization in the u s jewish community dedicated to fighting anti semitism declined detailed comment thursday but denied breaking any laws police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to gather political intelligence in at least seven cities including los angeles and san francisco groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political spectrum including such groups as the ku klux klan the white aryan resistance operation rescue greenpeace the national assn for the advancement of colored people the united farm workers and the jewish defense league also on the list were mills college the board of directors of san francisco public television station kqed and the san francisco bay guardian newspaper people who were subjects of the spy operation included former republican rep pete mccloskey jailed political extremist lyndon h larouche and los angeles times foreign correspondent scott kraft who is based in south africa authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement agencies they also alleged that data on some individuals and organizations was sold separately to the south african government in addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from police the anti defamation league could face a total of felony counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief west coast spy roy bullock according to the affidavit filed to justify the search warrant the anti defamation league disguised payments to bullock for more than years by funneling a week to beverly hills attorney bruce i hochman who then paid bullock according to the documents released in san francisco hochman a former president of the jewish federation council of greater los angeles and one of the state s leading tax attorneys will be out of the city until late next week and could not be reached for comment his office said until hochman a former u s prosecutor also was a member of a panel appointed by then sen pete wilson to secretly make initial recommendations on new federal judges in california hochman is a former regional president of the anti defamation league the league which initially cooperated with police has denied repeatedly that its intelligence gathering operation broke any laws league officials will not confirm or deny whether bullock was an employee and have said they simply traded information with police departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes but in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for thursday s searches san francisco police alleged that adl employees were apparently less than truthful in providing information during an earlier search conducted without a warrant david lehrer executive director of the los angeles adl office said the organization has not violated the law there is nothing nefarious about how we operate or what we have done he said our record speaks for itself the police affidavit contends that lehrer had sole control of a secret fund used to pay for fact finding operations lehrer according to the documents signed checks from the account under the name l patterson an adl official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending them directly to the anti defamation league bullock who has been collecting intelligence for the adl for nearly years defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with san francisco police he said that he gathered names from many sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as skins and pinkos but that did not necessarily mean that they were under surveillance i might never see or call up on of them again bullock said and it doesn t mean anything that they re in the files it s not a threat to anyone s civil rights that a name appears in my files under say pinko in recent years bullock worked closely with san francisco police officer tom gerard who fled to the phillippines last fall after he was questioned by the fbi in the case a former cia employee gerard supplied bullock with criminal records and department of motor vehicles information such as home addresses vehicle registration physical characteristics and drivers license photographs using files gathered for the anti defamation league gerard and bullock also provided information to the south african government receiving over four years the documents show the file on times staff writer kraft which was apparently sold to the south african government provides some insight into the hit and miss nature of the spy operation the file notes that kraft s articles appear frequently in the times and are well researched and written but little else about the file is accurate the brief entry confuses the times kraft with another scott kraft and provides the south african government with the wrong kraft s physical description photograph and other personal information nevertheless the documents provide illuminating details of how bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations from skinheads to left wing radicals searching regularly through the trash of target groups using anti defamation league funds he also ran his own paid informants under code names such as scott and scumbag he worked closely with police officers up and down the coast exchanged information with the fbi and worked with federal agencies including the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms it was bullock s work as a paid informant for the fbi while spying on behalf of the anti defamation league and the south african government that proved his undoing the fbi learned that he was an agent of a foreign government and began investigating leading to the probe of the anti defamation league s intelligence

richard c paddock times staff writer san francisco the anti defamation league defended its record as a civil rights group friday and said it will cooperate with authorities who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential police information on citizens and groups but san francisco dist atty arlo smith said that anti defamation league employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many felony counts of receiving confidential files eavesdropping tax violations and conspiracy police have accused the anti defamation league of not being truthful about its spying operations which collected information on more than individuals and political groups across the political spectrum hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors thursday show that the adl maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept files on political figures even so smith suggested that if the anti defamation league shut down its spy operation prosecutors would take that into account when deciding what charges to file in a statement released in washington national director abraham h foxman described the adl as a jewish defense agency which has fought to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for years foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing information to police

blossoms we ll do like the president q is the stimulus package dead mr stephanopoulos absolutely not q can you tell us more about the dole talks you said it was a good visit but no compromise mr stephanopoulos yes the president had a good talk with senator dole last night i think that as we said before there were no specific compromises on either side although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as well as you know the president first called senator dole i believe tuesday night to talk about the russian aid package they did not speak senator dole called him back wednesday morning when the president was out instead he spoke with tony lake and at the close of that conversation indicated that he wanted to speak to the president about the jobs and stimulus package they finally talked about that yesterday afternoon at the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night which they did when the senator was up in new hampshire and although there were no specific compromises made on either side they did say that they would continue to have some discussions and that s where we are q well who is giving in where is it standing are both making concessions mr stephanopoulos i don t know that it s at that phase no compromise has been made as the president has said consistently he intends to come forward with an adjusted package he believes in the package but he believes that if it s going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it he s willing to make those adjustments q on the subject of a vat mr stephanopoulos oh boy q can we stay on this for one more minute mr stephanopoulos sure q we have a problem with the five minutes q i know no decisions have been made but what would lead the health group to believe that a vat might be necessary mr stephanopoulos sorry andrea i m not going to go down that road no decisions have been made as the president said this morning a number of groups a number of members of congress a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked at the working group is looking at it but no decisions have been made q to follow have they done that directly through him have labor and business groups been in touch with the president about it mr stephanopoulos not to my knowledge although there s a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the vat but the president has not made a decision q at the meetings that he s had with his own task force advisers have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be mr stephanopoulos i don t think that that has been presented for a decision no q not for a decision but has it been discussed as an option mr stephanopoulos again there are a lot of levels of briefing i do not believe that the vat has been presented to the president as okay this is something for you to decide on q you re not saying he didn t know it was being considered though are you mr stephanopoulos no he said it s being considered q he knew that q but has he discussed that with his advisers that s what i m asking mr stephanopoulos the president has said it s being considered i do not know what level of discussion there has been over the vat it is something the working groups are looking at i don t even know that it s q but he didn t say he was considering did he at this stage mr stephanopoulos no he is not i think we re getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here what is considered q well he is the one who said i haven t reviewed it mr stephanopoulos that is true that is what i just repeated q george is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in february and the promise that if it were to be considered he d let us know and having it trickle out the way it did that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others mr stephanopoulos i don t think so i mean it is now public knowledge that this is being considered q is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered and then to have it come out not from you people but mr stephanopoulos well wait a second it came out from the administration what are you talking about q what i m saying is though that the president said he would let us know mr stephanopoulos right q you people then said you said i believe that it s not going to be on the program mr stephanopoulos on march th q on march th mr stephanopoulos circumstances change q well i understand but we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview mr stephanopoulos rooting around i know you did do a very good job there to read the usa today article but this is laughter the deputy director of the omb and the secretary of health and human services i mean that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the clinton administration the headline is i ll look at it right here and ap story clinton wants more money for spying q what about his remark that if it were being considered he d tell us about it mr stephanopoulos and the administration s concerned and he d let you know q and did he mr stephanopoulos yes absolutely what did he say this morning q it had to be dragged out of you here yesterday mr stephanopoulos it didn t have to be dragged out of me we had the deputy director of the omb we had the secretary of health of human services say it was being considered that is his administration that is his administration policy q were these authorized trial balloons or were they orchestrated leaks i mean what was the mr stephanopoulos they were asked questions they answered the questions q you re saying here that it didn t have to be dragged out that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering it mr stephanopoulos absolutely i was very clear painfully clear q was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day mr stephanopoulos no it was just this issue is being considered they were asked if it was being considered they answered that it was being considered q george the new york times q why do it yesterday mr stephanopoulos they were asked q the new york times reports today that secretary reich and the chief economist at the labor department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last month s unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the president s job stimulus bill but which turned out to be totally false mr stephanopoulos i don t know if it was totally false but i think laughter the chief economist at the labor department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing and they say that q the question is is the president concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data and what s he doing about it if so mr stephanopoulos the chief economist has said that a mistake was made it won t happen again and that s the end of the matter q isn t that the same information that goes to the president q if i could go back to the stimulus package mr stephanopoulos there s two separate pieces of information i think that s where the confusion was q when did you all first learn about this mistake that was made mr stephanopoulos i read the article this morning q and as far as you know is the president aware of it mr stephanopoulos i think so q and was he aware of it before he read about it in the new york times mr stephanopoulos i don t know not to my knowledge q did you ever hear about it before this morning anything mr stephanopoulos i didn t q wasn t the president given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose for his speeches for his arguments mr stephanopoulos well again i m not sure both statements are true what the labor department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence essentially was misleading they said it was a mistake they said they wouldn t do it again q did they drop it is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of mr stephanopoulos whenever fewer people are out of work we re gratified but that doesn t take away from the need to get this jobs package going q if i could go back to the stimulus package for a minute you said that the president plans to come forward with an amendment is the timetable still what it was that the amendment would be laid down on monday and voted on on tuesday or did he in the conversation with dole talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion mr stephanopoulos i think at this point there s no changes in the schedule at all i don t know that they discussed the timing like that q do you believe that you re closer or getting closer this week than you were last week mr stephanopoulos again i believe that we re going to pass a jobs package the president is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to happen i don t know where the votes are on cloture at this particular time i don t know what s going to happen until we have a vote but the president believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done q has there been any indication that this situation has changed mr stephanopoulos we re going to continue to work on it we ll know when the votes are taken q george last week you said that there are or various people in the administration were saying that you couldn t go through dole you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept this week you re talking to him is that because you ve realized that the peeling off effort wasn t going to work mr stephanopoulos that s because senator dole wanted to talk to the president about the stimulus package q he initiated the conversation mr stephanopoulos yes q secretary reich this morning said that in fact the president is not willing to compromise on this bill at all you say he s making mr stephanopoulos i don t know that that s exactly what he said i think he said he didn t have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise and the president doesn t want to compromise and the president doesn t want to compromise but if he has to make adjustments to get it through he will q officials here yesterday said that panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual vote mr stephanopoulos it s possible q today mr stephanopoulos i m not sure exactly when that will happen but i think that it s very possible that we ll come forward with some sort of a different package or senate democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it passed q as we understood his conversations with dole the first one was some discussion of this and i ll get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments or whatever the phrase is did he offer him some details or some adjustments mr stephanopoulos i think it s a question of how detailed i mean i think they had a general discussion about the package last night subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon i believe that there will be follow up discussions today in the senate not necessarily between the president and senator dole and let me just reiterate neither side has made specific compromises at this date when we have something we ll let you know and i m not suggesting that senator dole has accepted anything that we ve talked about or that we ve offered anything in a hard way q what are the follow up discussions if not the president and dole mr stephanopoulos i think senator mitchell is going to talk to senator dole q is that a threat laughter q did the president say to senator dole all right how about this number as an overall size or did dole say to the president i can go as high as this did they talk numbers mr stephanopoulos i don t think it was a negotiation in that respect it was more of a discussion about their positions q did they discuss actual numbers mr stephanopoulos i m just not sure i know they talked about the basic outlines of the packages i think they talked about the programs they cared about i don t know if they got to the level of this many x billion dollars q does dole have to sign off before there is a package mr stephanopoulos no of course not q did the white house have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in new hampshire today where senator dole was speaking was that in any way organized by mr stephanopoulos not to my knowledge no q and has the president been in touch with senators kohl or feingold mr stephanopoulos i don t think he s talked to them no q george is the president considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have nots and is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few with the haves having to pay for the have nots mr stephanopoulos the president believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income americans as he presented in his budget should go up and i think for the second half of your question i ll refer you to my briefing from yesterday q george on the subject of accuracy in information you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in milwaukee apparently that is not true it s actually waste water money mr stephanopoulos it s waste water money for wisconsin and some could go to milwaukee q but it would not affect the drinking water problem because it s waste water money right mr stephanopoulos it would affect the water treatment overall q but the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in milwaukee now would you agree that s not the case mr stephanopoulos i m not sure of the specifics i know that it goes to the overall water treatment in wisconsin q a leftover question from this morning which was when did the president find out that the task force was deliberating on a vat mr stephanopoulos i m not sure exactly when i just don t know i assume it came up over the last certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago q so sometime since march th mr stephanopoulos i think that s right i don t know the exact date q george the president this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the vat tax apparently the national association of manufacturers talks about perhaps the vat tax being okay if it replaces the btu tax so does the president feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he s proposed or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he s already proposed mr stephanopoulos i think we ve said all we have to say about the vat at this point i mean there s just no this is being considered by the health care working groups and that is all the president hasn t made any further decisions beyond that q but it would be to finance health care it wouldn t be to replace some other tax that finances it wouldn t replace the income tax for instance mr stephanopoulos there have been no discussions on that q in terms of getting a vat tax through congress senator dole s press release today said vat on tax day do you think does it have a chance of getting through congress would it have a chance mr stephanopoulos i have no idea q is that a consideration whether you all put it forward mr stephanopoulos that would become a consideration if the president were to decide to do it it s not in consideration now q you said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the vat to now be under consideration mr stephanopoulos yes what the president referred to this morning these groups came forward and said this is something that has to be considered q those are the circumstances that have changed that s the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered mr stephanopoulos that s what he said q is that true mr stephanopoulos yes q was there in fact some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits mr stephanopoulos i m not going to get into the deliberations q but george mr stephanopoulos no what the consideration is as the president said groups came forward and said this is something you ought to consider the working groups are looking at it q is that the only thing that s changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the vat mr stephanopoulos yes q can you explain how those groups how that information got to him that groups wanted it was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations mr stephanopoulos i think the groups as you know the health care task force has met with dozens of groups q but this is the president s knowledge that these groups had come forward mr stephanopoulos i think he was referring to what was coming to the working groups obviously there have also been published positions in the newspapers q have certain groups briefed him on the group s presentations to them mr stephanopoulos i don t know if they ve briefed him i mean how detailed the briefings have been i know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these groups q what kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the president would change the position that he had enunciated previously mr stephanopoulos i don t know it s just they ve had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health care q the president wasn t aware of those longstanding positions mr stephanopoulos he may have been at some level obviously he s been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a vat tax q what we re trying to figure out here you re telling us that the only change the only thing that affected this change in the president s attitude toward the vat between february and now mr stephanopoulos the president s attitude hasn t necessarily changed i mean he has not made a decision q i know but the president said that it was off the table so did you and you re saying that the only thing that s changed is the positions of these groups except you re also describing them as longstanding positions i don t see the change if these groups haven t had any change in their position that s been made to the president mr stephanopoulos well they ve made the presentations to the health care task force q there s no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said suggested in february that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance mr stephanopoulos i don t think he ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue q well he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health care mr stephanopoulos he did say that i don t know that he said anything to refute that q but in fact has the task force discovered that there wouldn t be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits mr stephanopoulos again i don t think that the task force ever suggested that there would q george if he advocated a vat tax would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs mr stephanopoulos i can t comment on a hypothetical situation q but does that promise would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a vat tax mr stephanopoulos the president has made no decisions on the vat tax when he does we ll tell you and we ll explain the implications then q which specific groups can you cite business labor or otherwise whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration mr stephanopoulos i don t have the specific i just don t have that q george can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives for instance the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are mr stephanopoulos no as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said they are looking at a wide variety of options i think that ira magaziner said that there are different options under consideration but i m not going to comment q what s the scope mr stephanopoulos i m just not going to comment on them no q what s the scope of the need how much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the mr stephanopoulos that s what the health care task force is looking at q since there s not going to be any briefing on the miyazawa visit two questions one generally what does the president hope to use that meeting for but more specifically is his task complicated by the japanese anger over the vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference mr stephanopoulos the vancouver note q does no mean yes q yes and no mr stephanopoulos well i don t know i saw the prime minister s press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the question the questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the prime minister and the president there is obviously a trade imbalance between japan and the u s that we want to do something about q also in those comments the prime minister made he suggested that the united states should come down heavy on him in terms of trade are you going to oblige mr stephanopoulos i think the president will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very clearly i don t necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the prime minister s comments q that we need specific export targets specific numerical targets is that what he s going to discuss with miyazawa mr stephanopoulos they re going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issues i don t want to get into those specifics until after the meeting q why q that s the crux of the issue right whether or not does the president believe that without specific numerical targets it is really as he said in his press conference sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much mr stephanopoulos the president believes that we must have pressure on japan to turn the trade imbalance around i do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be done q but does the president believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance mr stephanopoulos i think first the president wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from prime minister miyazawa himself and then he ll make the comment on it q how about the russian aid package there seems to be some confusion about how the u s views that secretary christopher saying or bentsen saying the japanese may need to do more the japanese saying that that s not what they heard mr stephanopoulos again we re going to continue to work with all our allies in the g and we re going to continue to press for help for russian reform russian democratic reform and i think that so far we had a very good announcement out of tokyo and we re going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral packages q do you think the japanese need to do more mr stephanopoulos we re going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we can q secretary christopher was asked today on the today show this morning what he thought of margaret thatcher s comments on the bosnia policy and he said it s a rather emotional response mr stephanopoulos over an emotional issue q right to an emotional problem does the white house condone that kind of remark mr stephanopoulos i think that secretary christopher s remarks speaks for itself the president believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that we re trying to find answers for q but that specific rather emotional response specific term mr stephanopoulos no it speaks for itself q in connection with that doesn t it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment is it good american policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help boris yeltsin win a referendum mr stephanopoulos for example q to take stronger action to take military action air strikes anything that can be done mr stephanopoulos the president believes that what must be done now is to push harder for sanctions he is also as you know the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo he believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this time q what is your response to the critics who would say that the u s is now stymied by trying to help boris yeltsin retain the presidency mr stephanopoulos they re wrong we re pressing hard for the serbs to come to the negotiating table we re pressing hard for increased sanctions and we re talking to our allies about the arms embargo q you were putting great store in vance and owen getting people to agree to that now vance and owen have both said that military force to some extent would be acceptable does that change your thinking mr stephanopoulos clearly we re going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say but at this point the president is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms embargo q a follow up on a dee dee comment this morning she said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in bosnia are you going to be able to do that or do you have anything mr stephanopoulos i don t think that s what she said q that s exactly what she said mr stephanopoulos i don t think that s true but what she said we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in bosnia obviously if there are connections between the bosnian serbs and the serbs in belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the serbs in belgrade that will have an effect over time i do not know day by day minute by minute what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has been but clearly we are slowing the shipment of goods into belgrade we are having an effect on the serbs there what kind of effect that will eventually have on the bosnian serbs i don t know but one thing i would say is if it were having no effect at all i don t know why they d be fighting it so much q are the first lady s tax returns going to be released mr stephanopoulos i think there s a joint tax return and it will be probably later today q is the president considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week mr stephanopoulos i don t think there s any proposal for that at this time not that i know of q it s something that the president promised during the campaign that he would do mr stephanopoulos i have not seen any i don t think it s anything that s on his plate right now q is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue mr stephanopoulos i don t know about on this issue i assume that he ll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and communities q do you know if that s scheduled mr stephanopoulos it s probably going to be tomorrow q probably going to be tomorrow laughter q it s a good thing you asked q who s probably going to be there laughter mr stephanopoulos i don t know q how long mr stephanopoulos i don t know that s all i know q do you know if it s at p m tomorrow laughter mr stephanopoulos i don t know what time it is i don t even know for sure if it s going to be tomorrow q environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some kind is that going to happen do you know mr stephanopoulos i don t know if they ve asked but i think the president has always planned as he did last year to give a speech on earth day and i expect that he will if it s not exactly on earth day it might be a day before or something like that q is he planning to sign or announce the signing of the biodiversity treaty in connection with earth day mr stephanopoulos again i don t know the specific timing of something like that but it s certainly something under discussion and something we ve been working on q campaign finance reform mr stephanopoulos we re working on it q do you think it will be next week mr stephanopoulos i m just not sure q the biodiversity treaty is something you re working on i missed the question mr stephanopoulos yes something we re working on he asked if it was ready to be signed and i said i didn t know anything about that but it s something we ve certainly been working on q do you know what organizations might be represented in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups mr stephanopoulos i don t q do you know if he is going to reconsider being out of town on the day of the march mr stephanopoulos he s got to be at the senate meeting in jamestown and i believe he s also going to be giving a speech to the american association of newspaper publishers in boston on sunday as he did last year q would you have told us if she had not pressed you on the question mr stephanopoulos on what q on the gays mr stephanopoulos when we went through the president s schedule for the day certainly q george what day is the publisher s speech is that sunday mr stephanopoulos i think it s a sunday q and saturday he ll be in jamestown mr stephanopoulos yes q so you re just going to be in jamestown for one day mr stephanopoulos no i m not sure i don t know how long the senate thing goes it might go overnight i just don t know q you would have made the gay meeting public right mr stephanopoulos i m certain if we had the meeting i don t know about open to the press but we would have told you about it q i mean because it is as far as i can tell the first time in history a president has met in the oval office with mr stephanopoulos i didn t say it was going to be in the oval office laughter but i didn t i m not say that it s not but i didn t say that it was laughter q at the white house in the bush administration gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the white house had to repudiate having done that so i just wanted to make sure mr stephanopoulos well the president wouldn t do anything like that q certainly not q what marching orders did the president give to general vessey mr stephanopoulos they had a very good discussion for about half an hour today he wanted the most important thing was he had a full accounting for american pows and mias he will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document the president stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy towards vietnam he ll be looking at vietnam s response to the questions raised by the document and he ll also look into investigations on discrepancy cases increased efforts on remains implementing trilateral investigations and access to military archives and ambassador toon also briefed the president on the activities of the joint commission and on the document q vietnam says it s a fake what is the dod analysis at this stage mr stephanopoulos it s not completed yet and it s also the first thing that general vessey will bring up with the vietnamese q a number of defense officials have been saying that they think that the or so prisoners referred to are in fact non americans that the vietnamese had captured who they referred to as americans from time to time do people mr stephanopoulos we don t have any final determination we re going to wait for the complete review when we have it we ll make a judgment q i know you don t have any final determination but given all of the intense public interest in this do you think that that s a likely possibility mr stephanopoulos i just don t want to characterize it in any way until the review is complete q george was there a topic scheduled for the speech in boston mr stephanopoulos no q is the president going to have a press conference tomorrow with miyazawa mr stephanopoulos i think so but i m not positive yes i expect yes q was toon in with vessey mr stephanopoulos yes q he was in on the meeting mr stephanopoulos yes q what was the question mr stephanopoulos was ambassador toon in with vessey and the answer is yes q do you have any response to the wall street journal report this morning the president s distressed about some of his press clippings and that perhaps he s distressed with you about that mr stephanopoulos no well i do have a response i think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied that the president has had restricted access to the press i would point out that he s answered questions on occasions more than any of his predecessors i would also point out it also q how many questions mr stephanopoulos three hundred fifty eight on occasions q how many were while he was jogging mr stephanopoulos well no that s actually a very good question andrea and i would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered at tightly controlled photo opportunities which is just patently false he s had press conferences in either the east room the oval office or the roosevelt room or the briefing room in addition to questions taken at photo opportunities and that is only the q oval office press conference when was that mr stephanopoulos he s answered questions in the east room he s had five in the east room he s had one in the oval office he s had one in the rose garden he s had one or two in the roosevelt room and this is just to the white house washington press corps in addition to that he s had interviews with local television anchors he s met with the editorial board of the portland oregonian he s had an hour long interview with dan rather he s had interviews with local press from california florida and connecticut q can you address the question of the attitude the article implies that he doesn t q why doesn t he like us laughter q did you really get blamed for that post story q the story is that you are you held responsible for it mr stephanopoulos i don t think i m going to comment about this q are you denying that the president has shown displeasure publicly mr stephanopoulos i am not commenting on the discussions between the president and myself q did the president write that letter to chris webber mr stephanopoulos what q the letter to the university of michigan basketball player mr stephanopoulos oh yes q that is an authentic letter mr stephanopoulos yes q since the president first talked about the vat in february he said at the time that he thought there probably should be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing does he still hold that position given the impact it could have mr stephanopoulos again i just can t comment on a proposal he hasn t made q george does the president have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow mr stephanopoulos well i think it will just a general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about including aids and other issues civil rights q the military issue mr stephanopoulos i m certain it will come up q is he using this event to name the aids mr stephanopoulos i don t think so q george what specifically is the president doing to prepare for tomorrow s meeting with the prime minister miyazawa mr stephanopoulos he s had briefing memos he s had general discussions with members of the treasury department the trade representative and others q report yet mr stephanopoulos i don t know if he has the report referred to in the times but ambassador kantor was here to brief him today q he was mr stephanopoulos yes q does he intend to use any of these instances that mr stephanopoulos again i don t know that the report s been presented but obviously the president will press hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred q in terms of the wall street journal the thrust was that there s a real schism here a hostility do you think he feels that way mr stephanopoulos not at all as i said on the record in the article i think the president likes reporters again i think that the thrust of the article was still misleading the thrust of the article was that in some way some attitude which the president may or may not have is affecting access when in fact he has the most open accessible administration than have any in recent history q can we come up to your office laughter mr stephanopoulos if you re invited the press thank you end p m edt\n", "label": "politics"}, {"text": "drug use up at younger age the article that follows was taken from the wednesday april issue of usa today drug use up at

the marijuana lobby is out in full force says robert bonner head of the drug enforcement administration the fact is they re losing the battle in more than of youths ages to said they smoked marijuana

estimated per students pct chg alcohol cigarettes marijuana amphetamines lsd cocaine crack source university of michigan institute for social research report we are not winning the war on drugs i think you can see that one of the tactics that the dea employs to give people the impression that the war on drugs is being won is to selectively quote statistics only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down the excerpt from time magazine that i included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the dea attempt to deceive the public usage of one particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone up a k a substitution also drug usage among one particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone up therefore if one takes a look at the big picture taking into consideration all the statistics then it s obvious that the so called war on drugs is being lost perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go but if one factors in alcohol abuse smoking and use of inhalants then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective for those of you who don t consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it s not a drug agencies like the dea only go after illegal drugs this is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular the solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some not all drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits you won t drop dead after using it a few times and then couple this with a massive drug education program the reason why i think legalization is part of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government s efforts to the contrary the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere e g drug education additionally legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts imho the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them as you already know people in the u s smoke a lot less than they used to this reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns laws restricting where people can light up warning labels on cigarette packages taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption and so on i propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out they are as follows drugs being sold must come with clear concise information which states the possible health hazzards involved with using this product and recommendations on how the drug should be used things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in all drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs through illegal channels part of the revenue collected from drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law enforcement make it a felony to sell drugs to minors people under the age of anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning information should also be a felony establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible this agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad drugs something that is a fairly serious problem now i m sure that many of the things i ve discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup nevertheless i thought it was a good idea to give my two cents actually a buck and a half all at once so you could get a good idea of where i currently stand on wod go

to sell his her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention as some many libertarians would argue on a case by case basis the cost benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile the libertarian agenda however does not call for this assessment it assumes that the costs of regulation of any kind always outweigh its benefits this approach avoids all sorts of difficult analysis but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic to say the least i have no objection to an analysis of medical care education national defense or local police that suggests a free market can provide a more effective efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through statist approaches with some notable exceptions however i do not see such nitty gritty worthwhile analysis being carried out by self professed libertarians excellently put even as a libertarian i have to admit government does do some things i like there is a beautiful performing arts complex in ft lauderdale that was partially built with tax dollars i don t know how much was private and how much was stolen i mean public but it is beautiful and i enjoy it keep in mind though most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it however i have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention power on a case by case basis in fact we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case by case basis as much as other issues judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office they do not try to decide just whether pro nazi pro choice pro life or pro tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office you can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case by case basis not so with economic issues government does tell taxi drivers exactly what they can charge but not the bus lines or the lawyers just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case by case basis we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case by case basis there is hope that a government can

did in late anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings given the choice between waiting a few weeks and taking an extra tax hit or selling in december with preferential tax treatment only a fool would choose the former not disputed the fact that brett can now construct post hoc calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point there was plenty of money style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late to sell now and save on taxes in case anyone missed it there was no shortage of similar advice late

clintonites cited above i ll try to clarify since this is not a case of clinton s dishonesty i won t necessarily defend him on other issues there were never any specific projects included in the community development block grant portion of the president s proposal congressional republicans in an effort to discredit the stimulus package selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish list of potential projects prepared by the us mayors conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed the document in question was designed to pressure the white house to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to congress it didn t work the billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish list if it were passed communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level in the case of spokane wa tom foley s home district no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool one of the republicans examples from the funds available in the stimulus package since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus package for all projects the plan instead was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage yup there are places where that is true the swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city the million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities if the block grants are cut from the stimulus package it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds and that is why the clinton administration has been publicizing the issue a final point one may or may not like community block grants it is worth noting however that congressional republicans opposition to them is new since the nixon administration republicans have

despite a widespread belief to the contrary the saturn v blueprints have not been lost they are kept at marshall space flight center on microfilm the problem in re creating the saturn v is not finding the drawings it is finding vendors who can supply mid s vintage hardware like guidance system components and the fact that the launch pads and vab have been converted to space shuttle use so you have no place to launch from by the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re modify the launch pads you may as well have started from scratch with a clean sheet design why data from space missions isn t immediately available investigators associated with nasa missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being scooped by people uninvolved in the mission however nasa frequently releases examples in non digital form e g photos to the public early in a mission risks of nuclear rtg power sources for space probes there has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to block the galileo and ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous numerous studies claim that even in worst case scenarios shuttle explosion during launch or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities the risks are extremely small two interesting data points are the may loss of two snap b rtgs which landed intact in the pacific ocean after a nimbus b weather satellite failed to reach orbit the fuel was recovered after months with no release of plutonium in april the apollo lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its snap rtg heat source which was jettisoned fell intact into the feet deep tonga trench in the pacific ocean the corrosion resistant materials of the rtg are expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to half lives of the pu fuel or about years doe to make your own informed judgement some

april impact of the space shuttle on the ozone layer from time to time claims are made that chemicals released from the space shuttle s solid rocket boosters srbs are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources the remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study charles jackman the atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was organized by dr michael prather nasa goddard institute for space studies the three groups involved michael prather and maria garcia nasa giss charlie jackman and anne douglass nasa goddard space flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and environmental research inc the effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere the following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine industrial sources kilograms year natural sources kilograms year shuttle sources kilograms year the shuttle source assumes space shuttles and titan rockets are launched yearly thus the launches would add less than to the total stratospheric chlorine sources the effect on ozone is minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by this is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares the influence of human made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a decrease in globally averaged ozone between and the influence of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible the launch schedule of the space shuttle and titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time theoretical results of this study have been published in the space shuttle s impact on the stratosphere mj prather mm garcia ar douglass ch jackman m k w ko and n d sze journal of geophysical research charles jackman

challenger astronauts died the challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion this is a well documented fact see the rogers commission report for example what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the kerwin team s medical forensic report the astronauts were killed when the more or less intact cabin hit the water at circa mph and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater their remains were recovered and after the kerwin team examined them they were sent off to be buried using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit you can t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit because it can t get there it is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between earth s surface and low orbit taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high orbit spacecraft yet another concise answer by henry spencer the face on mars there really is a big rock on mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face it appears in two different frames of viking orbiter imagery a much more facelike in appearance and the one more often published with the sun degrees above western horizon and a with the sun degrees from the west science writer richard hoagland has championed the idea that the face is artificial intended to resemble a human and erected by an extraterrestrial civilization most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely accidental other viking images show a smiley faced crater and a lava flow resembling kermit the frog elsewhere on mars there exists a mars anomalies research society sorry don t know the address to study the face the mars observer mission will carry an extremely high resolution camera and better

to become an astronaut first the short form authored by henry spencer then an official nasa announcement q how do i become an astronaut a we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut since it s probably impossible for a non russian to get into the cosmonaut corps paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts and the other nations have so few astronauts and fly even fewer that you re better off hoping to win a lottery becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast jet experience which means a military flying career forget that unless you want to do it anyway so you want to become a shuttle mission specialist if you aren t a us citizen become one that is a must after that the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply nasa s problem is not finding qualified people but thinning the lineup down to manageable length it is not enough to be qualified you must avoid being dis qualified for any reason many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job get a ph d specialize in something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil forget computer programming entirely it will be done from the ground for the fore seeable future degree s in one field plus work experience in another seems to be a frequent winner be in good physical condition with good eyesight do not get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would do to rked eyes and long term effects are poorly understood for that matter avoid any other significant medical unknowns if you can pass a jet pilot physical you should be okay if you can t your chances are poor practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in appearance and actions you ve got a tough selling job ahead trying to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds of other applicants and also that you will be a credit to nasa after you are hired public relations is a significant part of the job and nasa s image is very prim and proper the image you want is squeaky clean workaholic yuppie remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent keep your nose clean get a pilot s license and make flying your number one hobby experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non pilot jobs work for nasa of astronauts selected between and were military or nasa employees and the remaining two were a nasa consultant and mae jemison the first black female astronaut if you apply from outside nasa and miss but they offer you a job at nasa take it sometimes in the past this has meant you do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first think space they want highly motivated people so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation keep trying many astronauts didn t make it the first time nasa national aeronautics and space administration lyndon b johnson space center houston texas announcement for mission specialist and pilot astronaut candidates astronaut candidate program the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has a need for pilot astronaut candidates and mission specialist astronaut candidates to support the space shuttle program nasa is now accepting on a continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be considered all positions are located at the lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas and will involved a year training and evaluation program space shuttle program description the numerous successful flights of the space shuttle have demonstrated that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming routine the space shuttle orbiter is launched into and maneuvers in the earth orbit performing missions lastling up to days it then returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and flight crew the orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment and retrieval of satellites service of existing satellites operation of specialized laboratories astronomy earth sciences materials processing manufacturing and other operations these missions will eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space station the orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher orbits than can be achieved by the orbiter itself users of the space shuttle s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include government agencies and private industries the crew normally consists of five people the commander the pilot and three mission specialists on occasion additional crew members are assigned the commander pilot and mission specialists are nasa astronauts pilot astronaut pilot astronauts server as both space shuttle commanders and pilots during flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle crew mission success and safety in flight the pilot assists the commander in controlling and operating the vehicle in addition the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing the remote manipulator system in extra vehicular activities and other payload operations mission specialist astronaut mission specialist astronauts working with the commander and pilot have overall responsibility for the coordination of shuttle operations in the areas of crew activity planning consumables usage and experiment and payload operations mission specialists are required to have a detailed knowledge of shuttle systems as well as detailed knowledge of the operational characteristics mission requirements and objectives and supporting systems and equipment for each of the experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions mission specialists will perform extra vehicular activities payload handling using the remote manipulator system and perform or assist in specific experimental operations astronaut candidate program basic qualification requirements applicants must meet the following minimum requirements prior to submitting an application mission specialist astronaut candidate bachelor

for the astronaut candidate program must meet the basic education requirements for nasa engineering and scientific positions specifically successful completion of standard professional curriculum in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor s degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering biological science physical science or mathematics the following degree fields while related to engineering and the sciences are not considered qualifying degrees in technology engineering technology aviation technology medical technology etc degrees in psychology

aviation aviation management or similar fields application procedures civilian the application package may be obtained by writing to nasa johnson space center astronaut selection office attn ahx houston tx civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis when nasa decides to select additional astronaut candidates consideration will be given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is made applications received after that date will be retained and considered for the next selection applicants will be notified annually of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate continued interest in being considered for the program those applicants who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from consideration and their applications will not be retained after the preliminary screening of applications additional information may be requested for some applicants and person listed on the application as supervisors and references may be contacted active duty military active duty military personnel must submit applications to their respective military service and not directly to nasa application procedures will be disseminated by each service selection personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration once final selections have been made all applicants who were considered will be notified of the outcome of the process selection rosters established through this process may be used for the selection of additional candidates during a one year period following their establishment general program requirements selected applicants will be designated astronaut candidates and will be assigned to the astronaut office at the johnson space center houston texas the astronaut candidates will undergo a year training and evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to ongoing programs they will also participate in the basic astronaut training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight pilot astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in nasa aircraft during their candidate period applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does not insure selection as an astronaut final selection as an astronaut will depend on satisfactory completion of the year training and evaluation period civilian candidates who successfully complete the training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become permanent federal employees and will be expected to remain with nasa for a period of at least five years civilian candidates who are not selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within nasa depending upon agency requirements and manpower constraints at that time successful military candidates will be detailed to nasa for a specified tour of duty nasa has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates therefore qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply pay and benefits civilians salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the federal governments general schedule pay scales for grades gs through gs and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements and experience other benefits include vacation and sick leave a retirement plan and participation in

material below may not apply to you in general however systems connected to the net fall in one of three categories internet usenet or bitnet electronic mail may be sent between these networks and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special servers the space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them one mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list in addition to the general lists for space called space digest for internet users and space on bitnet there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below a second mechanism is usenet netnews this is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a group name the groups dealing most closely with space topics are called sci space news sci space sci space shuttle sci astro and talk politics space contributors post submissions called articles in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends it to other nearby machines similarly articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted gateway machines redirect the usenet sci space group into internet and bitnet mailing lists and vice versa the other usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists if you can receive netnews its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually

frequently why does the shuttle roll just after liftoff the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc g c says during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is commanded until an i loaded v rel sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved then the tilt maneuver roll program orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q alpha which in turn alleviates structural loading other advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved s band look angles and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target in second stage this really is a good answer but it s couched in nasa jargon i ll try to interpret we wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly negative angle a negative q alpha this causes a little bit of downward force toward the belly of the orbiter or the z direction and this force alleviates structural loading we have to be careful about those wings they re about the most delicate part of the vehicle the new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn t roll performance gain the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers the return to launch site decreased abort maneuver complexity the new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio antennae to have a good line of sight signal with the s band radio antennae on the orbiter improved s band look angles the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine the new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usually this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction the shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit this all begs the question why isn t the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with why does the shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer is that the pads were leftovers from the apollo days the shuttle straddles two flame trenches one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effects of this on any daytime launch the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust is fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top orbiter side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the saturn v s a side note the saturn v s also had a roll program don t ask me why i m a shuttle guy i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics he added that the roll maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack q alpha within a tight tolerance the yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a grad level math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four element array how to

venus failed minutes after launch in the guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the onboard computer took control however there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the range safety officer destroyed it although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect fortran do statement it was actually a transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing was omitted from the expression r dot bar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative of radius this error led the software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation mariner became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december of and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a very hot degrees fahrenheit now revised to degrees f world with a cloud covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid was later confirmed in mariner launched on november was lost when its protective shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary space unable to collect the sun s energy for power from its solar panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner mariner the sister probe to mariner did reach mars in and took the first close up images of the martian surface in all as it flew by the planet the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that mars was a dead world in both the geological and biological sense mariner was sent to venus in it reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by mariner plus the information that venus atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least times that of earth s or the equivalent of being feet under the surface of an ocean mariner and were sent to mars in and expanded upon the work done by mariner four years earlier however they failed to take away the concept of mars as a dead planet first made from the basic measurements of mariner mariner ended up in the atlantic ocean in when the rocket launcher autopilot failed mariner the sister probe to mariner became the first craft to orbit mars in it returned information on the red planet that no other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the martian surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup images of mars two small moons phobos and deimos mariner used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in the probe did return the first close up images of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four earth days mariner eventually made three flybys of mercury from to before running out of attitude control gas the probe revealed mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which makes up percent of the entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiters pioneer through failed to meet their main objective to photograph the moon close up but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between earth and the moon including new data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth all three craft had failures with their rocket launchers pioneer was launched on october pioneer on november and pioneer on december pioneer was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first u s spacecraft to orbit the sun in pioneer was originally designed to flyby venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to million kilometers in a record until mariner pioneer through were placed into solar orbit from to pioneer and are still transmitting information at this time pioneer e would have been number suffered a launch failure in pioneer became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in pioneer followed it in and then went on to become the first probe to study saturn in both vehicles should continue to function through and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever to do so pioneer venus also known as pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october pvo made the first radar studies of the planet s surface via probe pioneer venus also known as pioneer sent four small probes into the atmosphere in december of the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the surface though none were expected to survive to the surface the day probe did make it and transmitted for minutes on the ground before its batteries failed ranger lunar lander and impact missions ranger and were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series they were meant for high earth orbit testing in but rocket problems left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed ranger launched on january was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problems during the launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt ranger launched april had the same purpose as ranger but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside the first u s probe to reach the moon albeit without returning data ranger launched october and similar to ranger and lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon and drifted off into solar orbit ranger through had more modified lunar missions they were to send back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact with the moon ranger failed this objective in when its cameras did not operate ranger through performed well becoming the first u s lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter through were designed to orbit the moon and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo missions of the probes also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside all five probes of the series launched from to were essentially successful in their missions they were the first u s probes to orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions surveyor lunar soft landers the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the soil before this time it was feared by some that the moon was covered in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing vehicle surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from to only surveyor and were unsuccessful missions the rest became the first u s probes to soft land on the moon taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis apollo landed feet from surveyor in and returned parts of the craft to earth surveyor the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored the tycho crater region in viking mars orbiters and landers viking was launched from cape canaveral florida on august on a titan e centaur d rocket the probe went into martian orbit on june and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse planitia on july it soon began its programmed search for martian micro organisms there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings one thing scientists learned was that mars sky was pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image the viking orbiter kept functioning until august when it ran out of attitude control propellant the lander was switched into a weather reporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through but after november an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further orders communication was never regained again despite the engineers efforts through may of an interesting side note viking s lander has been designated the thomas a mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team the national air and space museum in washington d c is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition viking was launched on september and arrived in martian orbit on august the lander touched down on september in utopia planitia it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording one marsquake the orbiter had a series of attitude control gas leaks in which prompted it being shut down that july the lander was shut down on april the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around voyager outer planet flybys voyager was launched september and flew past jupiter on march and by saturn on november voyager was launched august before voyager and flew by jupiter on august by saturn on august by uranus on january and by neptune on august voyager took advantage of a rare once every years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet voyager could in principle have headed towards pluto but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up between the two probes our knowledge of the giant planets their satellites and their rings has become immense voyager discovered that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and aurorae three new satellites were discovered two of the major surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous volcanoes with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere when the two probes reached saturn they discovered over ringlets and satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable the weather was tame compared with jupiter massive jet streams with minimal variance a year great white spot band cycle is known titan s atmosphere was smoggy mimas appearance was startling one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings braids kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain voyager thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts continued the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channels were found on ariel and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains satellites and one more ring were discovered in contrast to uranus neptune was found to have rather active weather including numerous cloud features the ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring two other rings and other satellites were discovered neptune s magnetic axis was also skewed triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers what s liquid at k the two voyagers are expected to last for about two more decades their on target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond pluto their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause soviet planetary missions since there have been so many soviet probes to the moon venus and mars i will highlight only the primary missions soviet lunar probes luna lunar impact attempt in missed moon and became first craft in solar orbit luna first craft

venera probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in february of no images were returned venera attempt to place a lander capsule on venusian surface transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe became the first craft to impact on another planet in venera first probe to successfully return data while descending through venusian atmosphere crushed by air pressure before reaching surface in venera and mission profiles similar in venera first probe to return data from the surface of another planet in venera accomplished a more detailed mission in venera sent first image of venusian surface in was also the first probe to orbit venus venera accomplished similar mission venera returned first color images of venusian surface in venera accomplished similar mission venera accomplished radar mapping with venera of sections of planet s surface in more detailed than pvo vega accomplished with vega first balloon probes of venusian atmosphere in including two landers flyby buses went on to become first spacecraft to study comet halley close up in march of soviet mars probes mars first acknowledged mars probe in transmissions ceased enroute the following year zond first possible attempt to place a lander capsule on martian surface probe signals ceased enroute in mars first soviet mars probe to land albeit crash on martian surface orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the red planet in mars first successful soft landing on martian surface but lander signals ceased after seconds in mars attempt at orbiting mars in braking rockets failed to fire probe went on into solar orbit mars first fully successful soviet mars mission orbiting mars in returned images of martian surface comparable to u s probe mariner mars landing attempt in lander crashed into

human computer error phobos attempt to land probes on martian moon phobos the probe did enter mars orbit in early but signals ceased one week before scheduled phobos landing while there has been talk of soviet jupiter saturn and even interstellar probes within the next thirty years no major steps have yet been taken with these projects more intensive studies of the moon mars venus and various comets have been planned for the s and a mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been planned for how the many changes in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent states will affect the future of their space program remains to be seen japanese planetary missions sakigake ms t was launched from the kagoshima space center by isas on january and approached halley s comet within about million km on march the spacecraft is carrying three instru ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field plasma waves solar wind all of which work normally now so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on january into an orbit similar to the earth s the closest approach was at h m s jst utc h on january the geocentric distance was km this is the first planet swingby for a japanese spacecraft during the approach sakigake observed the geotail some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence the second earth swingby will be on june at re earth s radius and the third october at re hiten a small lunar probe was launched into earth orbit on january the spacecraft was then known as muses a but was renamed to hiten once in orbit the lb probe looped out from earth and made its first lunary flyby on march where it dropped off its lb midget satellite hagoromo japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around the moon joining the unites states and ussr the smaller spacecraft hagoromo remained in orbit around the moon an apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientists to lose track of it hagoromo s rocket motor fired on schedule on march but the spacecraft s tracking transmitter failed immediately the rocket firing of hagoromo was optically confirmed using the schmidt camera cm f at the kiso observatory in japan hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using the earth s atmosphere hiten made a close approach to the moon at jst utc h on february at the height of km from the moon s surface n e and fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into lunar orbit the following is the orbital calculation results after the approach apoapsis altitude about km periapsis altitude about km inclination deg to ecliptic plane period days planetary mission references i also recommend reading the

on american soviet european and japanese probe missions can be found in sky and telescope astronomy science nature and scientific american magazines time newsweek and various major newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions but also show you what else was going on with earth at the time events were unfolding if that is of interest to you space missions are affected by numerous political economic and climatic factors as you probably know depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go you might also wish to join the planetary society one of the

cassini is a joint nasa esa project designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv centaur in october of after gravity assists of venus earth and jupiter in a vvejga trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of upon arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of titan the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about hours while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about flybys of titan and targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objectives of the mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of saturn s atmosphere rings and magnetosphere conduct close up studies of saturn s satellites and characterize titan s atmosphere and surface one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere these hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through titan s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini the first director of the paris observatory who discovered several of saturn s satellites and the major division in its rings the titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan huygens who discovered titan and first described the true nature of saturn s rings key scheduled dates for the cassini mission vvejga trajectory titan iv centaur launch venus gravity assist venus gravity assist

sciences research adaptation to space spacecraft maintenence the old nasa approach explified by shuttle and ssf so far was to centralize functionality these projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it and ssf has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication over billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization meanwhile military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development the constellation firstly different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function thus we have the gps navstar constellation in hour orbits comsats in clarke and molniya orbits etc secondly the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed ssf s main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization we have the makings of a microgravity constellation now comet and mir for long duration flights shuttle spacelab for short duration flights the best strategy for this area is inexpensive incremental improvement installation of u s facilities on mir shuttle mir linkup and transition from shuttle spacelab to a much less expensive ssto spacehab comet or ssto sif comet we might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments eg the high radiation van allen belt or gas plasma gradients in comet tails the comet system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond leo we need to study life sciences not just in microgravity but also in lunar and martian gravities and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of leo this is a very long term low priority project since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude furthermore using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation and the sample size so i propose labratsat a constellation tether bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super van allen belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on earth moon earth mars earth asteroid etc trips the miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real time from earth thru a vr interface after several orbital missions have been flown follow ons can act as ldefs on the lunar and martian surface testing out the actual environment at low cost before billions are spent on astronauts by far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in clarke orbit i propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills once in place robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas attach solar battery power packs inject fuel etc once the fleet is working it can be spun off to commercial company s who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards by applying the successful constellation strategy and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of sts and old ssf we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost for a fraction of ssf s pricetag we can fix satellites where the satellites are we can study life s adaptation to a much large more representative variety of space environments and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and if needed in special purpose orbits n b we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality mars network and artemis are two good examples of this more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on mars that can be used to fuel planet wide rover ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return the descendants of labratsat s technology can be

tools accelerator design has been improving particularly with superconducting accelerating cavities which helps feasibility los alamos has expertise in high current accelerators lampf so i believe they know what they are talking about i will believe that this process comes even close to approaching technological and economic feasibility given the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of separating things first and having a different run for each actinide when i see them dump a few tons in one end and pull relatively clean material out the other once the costs technological risks etc are taken into account i still class this one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun sure it s possible and the physics are well understood but is it really a reasonable approach and i still wonder at what sort of burning rate you could get with something like this as opposed to what kind of energy you would really recover as opposed to what it

that i hugh kelso and bob lilly had with an aide of sen patty murrays we were there to discuss ssto and commercial space this is how it went after receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of ssto i called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local senator d patty murray washington state i started asking for an hour and when i heard the gasp on the end of the phone i quickly backed off to an hour later in that conversation i learned that a standard appointment is minutes we got the standard bozo treatment that is we were called back by an aide who scheduled a meeting with us in order to determine that we were not bozos and to familiarize himself with the material and to screen it to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material well i got allocated hour with sen murrays aide and we ended up talking to him for minutes with us ending the meeting and him still listening we covered a lot of ground and only a little tiny bit was dcx specific most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer there was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on every topic that we brought up but with murray being new we wanted to entrench ourselves as non corporate aligned i e not speaking for boeing local citizens interentested in space so we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to leo solar power satellites are a big focus here so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access and we hit the environmental stand on that we hit the tourism angle and i left a copy of the patric collins tourism paper with side notes being that everyone who goes into space and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist esp after seeing the smog over l a we hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification which is more pronounced in space and said that that had potential to lead to understanding of and maybe a cure for osteoporosis we hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there they go on to other fields with low cost to orbit the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed we hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle we hit the lower cost of satellite launches gps navigation personal communicators tellecommunications new services etc jobs provided in those sectors jobs provided building the thing balance of trade improvement etc we mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs we left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do and he asked questions on this point we ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost much like condor or majellan and most importantly we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to leo in the middle we also gave a little speal about the lunar resource data purchase act and the guy filed it separately he was very interested in it he asked some questions about it and seemed like he wanted to jump on it and contact some of the people involved with it so something may actually happen immediatly there the last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions and if we didn t know the answers that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers then finally we asked for an appointment with the senator herself he said that we would get on the list and he also said that knowing her this would be something that she would be very interested in although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled since

other info the sightings were apparently spurious there is no planet inside of the orbit of mercury the idea of vulcan came from the differences between mercury s observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to newtonian physics leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid th century and simon newcombe later improved on the observations and re calculated using leverrier s system of equations now leverrier was one of the co discoverers of neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with mercury but alas twere not so mercury s perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun s mass this explanation had to wait until and albert einstein s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies commonly called special relativity with reimanian geometry the result was the general theory of relativity and one of it s most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of mercury s perihelion

the redesign of the space station a low option of billion a mid range option of billion and a high option of billion will be considered by the committee each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year through and would include funds for development operations utilization shuttle integration facilities research operations support transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds over the next years billion is reserved within the nasa budget for the president s new technology investment as a result station options above billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the nasa budget for example a space station option of billion would require billion in offsets from the nasa budget over the next years gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee generally the members designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted they also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the station redesign team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider gibbons also announced that the united states and its international partners the europeans japanese and canadians have decided after consultation to give full consideration to use of russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process to that end the russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as needed consulting basis so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of mir and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems the u s and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the russian participants in assessing russian systems and technology the overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities careful integration of russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal gibbons reiterated that president clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents however he also is committed to a space station

"label": "space"}, {"text": "nasa wraps in the april edition of one small step for a space activist allen sherzer tim kyger write another problem is what are called wraps or sometimes the center tax when work for a large program like freedom or shuttle is performed at a nasa center the center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts to a slush fund this money is used to fund work the center manager wants to fund this sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated think about that of the billion cost of freedom fully billion won t be spent on anything having anything to do with space stations now maybe that billion was wisely spent and maybe it wasn t but the work done with it should stand on its own merits not distorting the cost of other projects congress has no idea of the existense of these wraps congress has never heard the term center tax they look at the station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it doesn t add up they wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else my dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here a couple of weeks ago when i first read this in your posting i talked with one of the cost experts here in space station at headquarters if you wondering why i didn t post a response immediately i do have a real job i m supposed to be doing here at headquarters digging up old khz data looking into sherzer kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority also i spent last weekend in kansas city at the national science teachers association conference extolling the virtues of ssf to science teachers first off yes the concept of center tax or wrap does exist if i recall the numbers correctly the total tax for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around million this was computed by adding up the wp wp and wp center taxes with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at billion my calculater says the tax percentage is over the life of the ssf program using your figure of billion for the cost of ssf a tax at a rate comes to million this is alot less than billion but i will concede it s still an appreciable amount of pocket change i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at could be close to the actual rate the tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center kind of like mcdonalds at some states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you don t if you get it take out for example at wp the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the rocketdyne contract and are not subject to the center tax i don t have the numbers in front of me but i d guess at least of the wp funds go to rocketdyne so you could be right about a tax rate of but it s only applied to funds spent at the center and not to the prime contracts this leads to the obvious question what is the government doing with ssf funds that don t go to the prime contractors i e ok wp gets a slice of the billion pie a big portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne what happens to the balance of the funds which aren t eaten up by the center tax at wp we call these funds we spend in house supporting development funds as they are supporting the development work done by rocketdyne we have used these funds to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture our testbed has a real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research a few years back with lead acid car batteries to simulate the nickel hydrogen batteries on ssf dc switchgear dc dc converter units and simulated loads data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system we have also used the supporting development money to purchase nickel hydrogen batteries which are on life testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in indiana as a side point of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone cells have completed to cycles the on orbit batteries go through cycles per year as a final example my home division at lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations for performing system analyses like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculations using a monte carlo simulation setting up a database with information on weight of the power system elements finally the money raised by the tax does not all go into a slush fund at lewis the director does control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter most of the tax however goes to fund the general services at the center like the library the central computer services division the contractor who removes the snow etc thus it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget doesn t go for ssf activities to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support ssf which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for year is billable to ssf would you base it on the person hours ssf employees spend reading av week versus the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare this estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library who knows maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about a burecratic nightmare my last point is that i can t believe your claim that congress has never heard of the term center tax unfortunately all of the nasa testimony before congress isn t on a computer so i can t do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong but surely in some gao audit somewhere these nasa cost methods were documented for congress\n", "label": "space"}, {"text": "dc x rollout report mcdonnell douglas rolls out dc x huntington beach calif on a picture perfect southern california day mcdonnell douglas rolled out its dc x rocket ship last saturday the company hopes this single stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single stage to orbit ssto rocket ship the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands missile range in new mexico this week flight tests will start in mid june although there wasn t a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for ssto research remains cloudy the sdi organization which paid million for the dc x can t itself afford to fund full development of a follow on vehicle to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub orbital dc xa sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space based sensors and weapns however recent changes in sdi s political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto less of a priority today the agency is more interested in using dc x as a step towards a low cost reusable sounding rocket sdio has already done briefings to other government agencies said col simon pete worden sdio s deputy for technology but worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program i didn t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i have available to spend he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell douglas astronautics headquarters while sdio has lowered its sights on the program s orbital objective agency officials hail the dc x as an example of the better faster cheaper approach to hardware development the agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of evolutionary technology developments worden said the dc x illustrates how a build a little test a little approach can produce results on time and within budget he said the program which went from concept to hardware in around months showed how today s engineers could move beyond the miracles of our parents time the key is management worden said sdio had a very light hand on this project we had only one overworked major jess sponable although the next phase may involve more agencies worden said lean management and a sense of government industry partnership will be crucial it s essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially sdio s approach also won praise from two california members of the house science space and technology committee this is the direction we re going to have to go said rep george brown the committee s democratic chairman programs that stretch aout to years aren t sustainable nasa hasn t learned it yet sdio has rep dana rohrbacher brown s republican colleague went further joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency rohrbacher whose orange county district includes mcdonnell douglas also criticized nasa air force work on conventional multi staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology let s not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top let s build a spaceship although rohrbacher praised sdio s sponsorship he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology mcdonnell douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its c transport and space station freedom programs were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment on very large ventures companies put in seed money said charles ordahl mcdonnell douglas senior vice president for space systems you need strong government investments while the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the dc xa they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development citing corporate history they liken the process to douglas aircraft s dc aircraft just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the dc transport a gradual evolution in single stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper dc flight tests this summer at white sands will expand the envelope of performance with successive tests increasing speed and altitude the first tests will reach feet and demonstrate hovering verticle take off and landing the second series will send the unmanned dc x up to feet the third and final series will take the craft up to feet maneuvers will become more complex on third phase the final tests will include a pitch over manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom down configuration for a soft four legged landing the flight test series will be supervised by charles pete conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo moon landing now a mcdonnell douglas vice president conrad paised the vehicles aircraft like approach to operations features include automated check out and access panels for easy maintainance if the program moves to the next stage engine technology will become a key consideration this engine would have more thrust than the pratt whitney rl a engines used on the dc x each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to pounds of thrust based on the engine used in centaur upper stages the a model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three to on throttling capability it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround worden said future single stage rockets could employ tri propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union the resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes the mechanism for the teaming may already be in place pratt has a technology agreement with npo energomash the design bureau responsible

of the space station on april three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station a low option of billion a mid range option of billion and a high option of billion will be considered by the committee each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year through and would include funds for development operations utilization shuttle integration facilities research operations support transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds over the next years billion is reserved within the nasa budget for the president s new technology investment as a result station options above billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the nasa budget for example a space station option of billion would require billion in offsets from the nasa budget over the next years gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee generally the members designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted they also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the station redesign team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider gibbons also announced that the united states and its international partners the europeans japanese and canadians have decided after consultation to give full consideration to use of russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process to that end the russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as needed consulting basis so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of mir and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems the u s and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the russian participants in assessing russian systems and technology the overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes careful integration of russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal gibbons reiterated that president clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents however he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the

we re all supporting what each of us thinks should be done to some degree if you have a problem with what nick thinks should be done address it instead of just complaining about his doing so fred again you really don t get what the complaints are about do you not incredibly clear explanation of complaints something between feelings regarding nick s method and judgments about his meaning t maybe i d get it if you said what the complaints are about rather than doing the same things that you mean to complain about when you trash people how am i supposed to read that as trashing people is bad f gee funny that you get it now then deliberate obtuseness perhaps fred s issue nick s alleged trashing of others i only got it when you stopped trashing and made your point patently instead of allegorically that was my point all along fred not only do you do the same thing on the net honestly reporting your ideas on matters of policy and projects in space but your response was just baiting not even part of a debate i have yet to see nick enter into anything remotely resembling a debate i see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with the one true szabo plan i see him attacking people calling them lazy bastard because they had the temerity to disagree with the almight nick i see him questioning peoples ethics again because they had the temerity to disagree with lord god szabo but debate bwaaaaahhhaaaa i m glad you can laugh since your ratio of debate insult is about the same not even close tommy and generally only when i m dealing with someone like nick i see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate suffice to say that i disagree with you on that last point why don t you take a poll fred if you want some psuedo objective point of view and as usual you defend your insults with he started it yeah i took some of his research and called it my own but he started it so what if i stole his car he stole my lawnmower first besides that i think it s still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it so your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool i never borrowed it i already gave it back and it was broken when you gave it to me make up yer mind fred i m not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space based process and your response doesn t tell me a thing about the reasons why you think they should be except to impune the motives of the person with a divergent opinion who said i think they should be tommy show me a note where i said that and i ll eat this terminal see below fred fred i cocluded that you did since you took issue with it the fact that my conclusion was incorrect i e that you were taking issue with something different is evidence that your communication style is confusing or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate first i try to address what i think you meant for which i am rewarded with a denial of sorts and a smart remark then i point out that i am not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly interpreting you a second time and i m stupid for it i just can t win can i fred you ve got a great point here somewhere it s just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it please quote the it i took issue with i believe you will see if you look that what i was and am taking issue with is mr szabo s idea that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his toaster based infrastructure is finished all hail the szabo plan fred issue nick s alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nick s or you would have a really good point instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had my reading of what nick actually said is that people aren t required in all parts of all space processes so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program i read as people are required in all parts of all space processes so help me out here fred since i m so patently stupid did you read nick wrong or are you going to eat your terminal now if the latter i sure hope it s one of those cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about the point is i am not stupid because of your incorrect assumption i d only be stupid if i insulted you for having made it but alas that s your job fred and finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points simultaneously with an allegory insult sadly one point addressed a plan that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone more deliberate lack of understanding tommy no no i finally got it you don t like the plan that nick s posts made you imagine and you don t like nick s obnoxious behavior even though it s no worse than your own thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself if you have a problem with nick s delivery address that the way you bait you re perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of no tommy the bait is that which elicits the response nick baits i just flame him for being an obnoxious fool i don t really care who started it i read this list to get information and other s views on the issues to which it was dedicated not to be your mom he started it no he did or to hear about why nick is a very bad guy if you think flaming is bad stop flaming or at least get to the point in the first post instead of explaining yourself all the time that s nice tommy when you pay me to post to the net you can complain about not getting your money s worth perhaps if you weren t deliberately too thick to get the point the first time i wouldn t have to waste time explaining myself all the time of course socrates how could it be otherwise i think it s neat how all this criticism from you started after your fatherly admonitions to me about how such things should be handled outside usenet were somewhat rebuffed being a little hypocritical tommy to go with the immaturity or is this just the pique of a net ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he thought was new and hence could be instructed tommy i saw you come on the net who cares who came on the net first if you do consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus before which i was on for about years if you had seen me on the net first you d remember when nick and i went down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior it s just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that s no worse than your own let s see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn t and my complaints about your name calling are immature while your name calling isn t yeah right maybe if you called me some more names i might see it better fred net ghod wannabe naturally fred you ve correctly interpreted my motivations when yours are impossible to judge from your actions as your insulting of people that try proves i didn t really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what i really

ozone layer forwarded from public information office jet propulsion laboratory california institute of technology national aeronautics and space administration pasadena calif contact mary a hardin for

the april flight from california s barstow daggett airport reached an altitude of kilometers feet and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the upper atmosphere research satellite uars the data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the atmospheric trace molecular spectroscopy atmos experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle discovery we launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program in fact jpl is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways said dr jim margitan principal investigator on the balloon research campaign there are two jpl instruments on the uars satellite he continued the atmos experiment is conducted by jpl scientists and the jpl balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities as well as data that is useful in its own right the measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere specifically the mid latitude stratosphere during winter and spring understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions the scientific balloon payload consisted of three jpl instruments an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere and a fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight launch occurred at about noontime and following a three hour ascent the balloon floated eastward at approximately kilometers per hour knots data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard the flight ended at p m pacific time in eastern new mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon we needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements margitan explained and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear it will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments they will then forward their data to the uars central data facility at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland for use by the uars scientists the balloon was launched by the national scientific balloon facility normally based in palestine tex operating under a contract from nasa s wallops flight facility the balloon was launched in california because of the west to east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest the balloons are made of micron mil or less than one thousandth of an inch thick plastic and are cubic meters million cubic feet in volume when fully inflated with helium meters feet in diameter the balloons weigh between and kilograms and pounds the

office he works for is an administrative convenience i visited hunter at the beginning of feb and we toured the gun at the time i was working on gas gun r d at boeing where i work but i am now doing other things helping to save the space station the gun uses a methane air mixture which is burned in a chamber about ft long by inch id i e it looks like a pipe the chamber holds a ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m s down the chamber on the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres the piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures at around psi the barrel of the gun is about feet long and has a inch bore it is mounted at right angles to the chamber i e they intersect this was done so that in the future the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber the projectile being used in testing is a kg cylinder of lexan plastic in in diameter and about cm long all of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel the barrel is evacuated and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film a little thicker than saran wrap the plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile the gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs in the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found at the higher speeds in later testing the projectile vaporizes the testing is into a bunker because the livermore test range is about miles across and the projectile would go km if fired for maximum range the intent is to move the whole gun to vandenberg afb after the testing is complete where they can fire into the pacific ocean and use the tracking radar at vafb to follow the projectiles the design goal of the gun is to throw a kg projectile at km s half of orbital speed so far they have reached km s and the gun is currently down for repairs as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware i think it had to

theoretical strength this gives a working height of miles for a constant section column a constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up for example let us say you have a pound load to support at the top of the tower for simplicity in calculation this requires square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight the mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh lb so at mile below the payload the total load is now lb a increase the next mile of structure must be thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom we can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at lb and how much load you need to support on the ground for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support let us arbitrarily choose billion as the limit in costruction cost with this we can afford perhaps lb of composites assuming our finished structure costs lb the lb figure is just for materials cost then we have a tower payload mass ratio of at a mass ratio per mile the tower height becomes miles this is clearly above the significant atmosphere a rocket launched from the

interesting opinion piece in the business section of today s la times thursday april p d i thought i d post it to stir up some flame wars i mean reasoned debate let me preface it by saying that i largely agree that the space age in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time reading for example what s new the weekly physics update we get here on the net it s clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine grained manipulation of matter by which i include biotechnology condensed matter physics with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days to a large extent i think the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia i feel sure that someday we or more precisely our mind children will spread across space unless we wipe ourselves out but i think that manned space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do now anyway let me quote some of this article but not all space age glory fades from view micheal schrage writer consultant and research associate at mit at america s space age won t have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis the reason is that the space age is already dead the technologies no longer define our times and the public has grown weary of the multibillion dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of america s science and technology debate into a peripheral issue speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy to be sure america should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing cheap deep space probes would be nice too but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead before the change in administrations it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the space age the bush white house aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over billion to build space station freedom alone even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains office of management and budget director richard darman was an outspoken public champion of big ticket space expenditures the reality that much of the civilian space program from the shuttle to the hubble telescope to the space station was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism not a coherent vision or cost effective sensibilities determined multibillion dollar space budgets indeed with few notable exceptions such as voyager the post apollo era is the story of the gold plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more while the clinton administration has kept on the highly regarded daniel goldin as administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of america s technological prowess the space station budget has rightly been slashed space is virtually ignored when the administration champions its competitiveness agenda i wish this had happened years ago instead of starting to happen now says bruce murray a caltech professor who ran nasa s jet propulsion lab in

is that natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel we ll just find the trajectory that makes it possible the originator of the technique said that nasa wasn t interested but that

virtual reality network announcement posted to the internet by wmiler nyx cs du edu david the lunar tele operation model one ltm by david h mitchell march introduction in order to increase public interest in space based and lunar operations a real miniature lunar like environment is being constructed on which to test tele operated models these models are remotely controlled by individuals located world wide using their personal computers for edutainment purposes not only does this provide a test bed for simple tele operation and tele presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space including but not limited to layout of a lunar colony tele operating machines for work and play disseminating educational information providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in twenty first century remote learning methods because of the nature of the ltm project people of all ages interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals models and structures interfacing and electronics software and graphics in operation ltm is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children students and professionals worldwide using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele operate real models at the ltm base for experimental or recreational purposes because a real facility exists ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves this has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups tele operations and virtual reality research radio control model railroad and ham radio operation astronomy and space planetariums and science centers art and theater bbs and online network users software and game developers manufacturers and retailers of model rockets cars and trains children the child in all of us ltm overall design a room feet by feet contains the base lunar layout the walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains star fields and a view of the earth the floor is the simulated lunar surface a global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements scenery and machine lets the ltm initial design has tele operated machinelets an ssto scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area and a moon train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface each machinelet has a small tv camera utilizing a ccd tv chip mounted on it a personal computer digitizes the image including reducing picture content and doing data compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes and also return control signals the first machinelet to be set up will be the moon train since model trains with tv cameras built in are almost off the shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal the user will receive an image once every to seconds depending on the speed of their data link to ltm next an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspended from a servo motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the ssto to be controlled by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and land finally some tank models will be modified to be ccd tv chip equipped bulldozerlets the entire initial ltm will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff traveling and doing work the entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware software developers by taking a graphically oriented communications program dmodem and adding a tele operations screen and controls the necessary user interface can be provided in under man hours plan of action the diaspar virtual reality network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and internet access to that network diaspar is providing the foot by foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model diaspar has in stock the electronic tanks that can be modified and one ccd tv chip diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock for the lunar train model diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines lets an initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo session and news conference on april the initial models will be put in place a time lapse record will be started for historical purposes it is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn the lunar colony will be declared open for additional building operations and experiments a photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to gif images for distribution world wide to major online networks and bbs s a press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas time talent materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony a contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced universities will be invited to participate the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model field trips to ltm can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model contributors will then be able to tele operate any contributed machine lets once they return to their campus a monthly ltm newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media any major new tele operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media having a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community especially since the action will be controlled by people all over the world science fiction writers will be invited to issue challenges to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele operated equipment to perform lunar tasks using counter weight and pulley systems gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges the long term goal is creating world wide interest education experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony ltm has the potential of being a long term global edutainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space edutainment all of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars conclusion edutainment is the blending of education and entertainment anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purposes by creating a tele operated model lunar colony we not only create world wide publicity but also a method of trying new ideas that require real not virtual skills and open a new method for putting people s minds in space moonlighters illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar

is no such thing as wrap at this university dennis i have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of customers included government including nasa for profit and non profit companies all expected a wrap usually called a fee much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors the subcontractors where universities for profits non profits and even some of the nasa centers for the commercialization of space all charged fees as part of the work down the street is one of the nasa commercialization centers they charge a fee you totally forgot the original post that you posted allen in that post you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any overhead geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true now i m sure your a competent engineer dennis but you clearly lack experience in several areas your posts show that you don t understand the importance of integration in large projects you also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything this isn t a flame jsut a statement come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration this is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it your employer does charge a fee you may not see it but you do of course there is a fee it is for administration geez allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in legitimate costs such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally stated it you stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true which is it allen sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate go ask your costing people how much fee they add to a project i did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this is included in the overhead well there you are dennis as i said they simply include the fee in their overhead many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer as you have posted on this subject allen you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge you admit here that this is wrong nasa has a line item budget every year i have seen it allen get some numbers from that detailed nasa budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it until you do that you are barking in the wind no allen you did not you merely repeated allegations made by an employee of the overhead capital of nasa integration dennis isn t overhead nothing that reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the other nasa centers where the work is going on integration could be done better at the centers apollo integration was done here at msfc and that did not turn out so bad the philosophy of reston is totally wrong allen there you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee there is no way that will ever work it has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on could you imagine a reston like set up for apollo dennis reston has been the only nasa agency working to reduce costs when wp was hemoraging out a billion the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station oh you are full of it allen on this one i agree that jsc screwed up big they should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced to make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes come to msfc for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter what the facts are contrary to it kinda funny isn t it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is overhead when you have a bit more experience dennis you will realize that integration isn t overhead it is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort i agree that integration is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort what i completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from the people that are doing the work it is called leadership allen that is what made apollo work final responsibility for the success of apollo was held by less than people that is leadership and responsibility there is neither when you have any organization set up as reston is you could take the same people and move them to jsc or msfc and they could do a much better job why did it take a year for reston to finally say something about the problem if they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place there is one heck of a lot i do not know allen but one thing i do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership i remember all of the turn over at reston that kept ssf program in shambles for years do you it is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem lack of leadership from the white house congress and at reston nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem you are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this why did the space news artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems methinks that you are being selective with the facts again the story you refer to said that some nasa people blamed it on congress suprise suprise the fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn t address the problems until the press published the story are you saying the reston managers where wrong to get nasa to address the overruns you approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns no i am saying that if they were located at jsc it never would have happened in the first place if it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of million a flight then you pay billion a year you stated that your friend at reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap were gone this merely points out a blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see you should know dennis that nasa doesn t include transport costs for resuply that comes from the shuttle budget what they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport sorry gang but i have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going to have to do allen s math for him for a while i will have little chance to do so i do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of reston to ask that the problems with wp be addressed i have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at jsc the problem never would have happened totally ignoring the lack of leadership of congress this many

reason to have a moon base is economic since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much larger gnp than they would without space industry eventually they will simply be able to afford more stuff if i read you right you re saying in essence that with a larger economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste on a lunar facility that was certainly partially the case with apollo but real lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military scientific or commercial reason for being rather than just a we have the money why not approach i was assuming that there won t be a moon base unless it makes a profit actually if it does well that gives a larger gnp which leads to being able to spend more money on your military including gosh wow space stuff assuming it s profitable rather than paying for itself it s conceivable that luna will have a military purpose it s possible that luna will have a commercial purpose but it s most likely that luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at least therefore lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for antarctic bases can you put a person

science dept on this subject specifically on a small scale solar sail proposed as a student space project the guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project i ll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting here goes the microlight solar sail introduction the solar sail is a well established concept harnessing the pressure of sunlight a spacecraft would have unlimited range in principle such a vehicle could explore the whole solar system with zero fuel consumption however it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize the pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a conventional type spacecraft is a daunting task this is why despite the potential of hte idea no such craft has actually been launched to date design recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics with no mechanical parts several attitude control methods are feasible for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn the key components of the craft will be a minute ccd camera developed at edinburgh university which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device solar cells providing watt power for control and communication and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself launched as a piggyback payload the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars missions the craft would be capable of some ambitious missions for example a it could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the apollo or amor groups closeup pictures could be transmitted back to earth at a low bit rate b it could be steered into a lunar polar orbit previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed by angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base btw c it could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus impacting at low speed a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp edged tube like performing a biopsy returning to earth the sail acts as an ideal re entry parachute load per unit area gm m ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed deg c the material sample is recovered enclosed in a small insulating container contact

that luna will have a commercial purpose but it s most likely that luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at least therefore lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for antarctic bases can you put a person base on the moon for million a year even if you use grad students you might be able to run one for that put it there hardly why do you think at least a couple centuries before there will be significant commerical activity on the moon wishful thinking mostly it s more likely that the moon will never be the site of major commercial activity as far as we know it has no materials we can t get cheaper right here on earth or from asteroids and comets aside from the semi mythic he that might be useful in low grade fusion reactors exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch and it s position in the gravity well of earth coupled with it s heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for high ground military weapons systems but it holds very minute commercial value if space travel becomes cheap enough it might become a tourist attraction as mt everest and the antarctic have become but that s a very minor activity in the global scope of things luna has an inconvienent gravity field it s likely too low to prevent calcium loss muscle atrophy and long term genetic drift yet it s too high to do micro g manufacturing space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of g look much better luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials heatsink and shielding the asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements and volatile compounds and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta v is required to reach them we don t use rds of the earth now the seafloors and we virtually ignore antarctica a whole continent that s because we don t have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck luna is a much more expensive place to visit or to live and work i think we ll use the easier places first that pushes lunar development back at least a few centuries if not much longer luna s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory shielded from the noisy earth or as the site of a laser particle beam or linear accelerator weapons system for defending earth or bombarding it as the case may be the first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument the second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough and the military would really rather see the earth safe for

off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat s hair i ve heard the argument that an active but uncontrolled spacecraft causes radio noise i find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed safe mode this safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation and once a week month year whatever attempts a signal lock on earth at that time if funding has been restored the mission can continue if no signal is recieved the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period as we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact earth we could be prepared if necessary as another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards earth if someone can receive it great if not so it s lost and no big deal by making the time and signal location generally known perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they re not

recent article in aw st about a low cost it s all relative manned return to the moon a general dynamics scheme involving a titan iv shuttle to lift a centaur upper stage lev and crew capsule the mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface followed by a manned mission total cost us was billion joint esa nasa project was billion for the us share i didn t find a mention of how long the crew could stay but i d bet that its around days and the total payload delivered was about metric tonnes so if you ignore the scientific payload hitch a ride in the crew habitation module no return trip and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another months then you might be able to get a year visit out of tonnes and in case its not obvious that s a wild ass guess a pretty boring visit since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of lox and i m not certain if a home brewed or college brewed life support system could last a year but let s round this up to tonnes convient since the gd plan talks about ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface this adds up to two centaurs two levs two shuttle flights all to put a single man on the moon for a year hmmm not really practical anyone got a cheaper better way of delivering tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year s supply of consumables and equipment would weigh and i was wondering about the gd lev is it reusable or is it discarded to burn up on return to leo if its not discarded could it be refueled henry do you know anything about the gd lev i noted that it uses rl engines aren t they reusable restartable would a lev fit in a dc i ve forgotten if i ever knew what the cargo bay dimensions are for the dc all in all i m not certain that the single goal prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and or useful how about a prize for the first non government sponsered unmanned moon landing then another for a manned moon landing then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil another for a reusable earth moon shuttle and so forth find some way to build civilian moonbase

one also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode probably a spin stabilized sun pointing orientation is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft in order to turn the spacecraft back on you either need to insure that the ops guys will be available or you need to retrain a new team having said that there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed many of the operational satellites goddard flies like the tiros noaa series require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set extras which get replaced on orbit are powered into a standby mode for use in an emergency in that case however the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap finally pat s explanation some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control is also right on the mark i suggested a spin stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance but it

tells of its triumphs living history they are we are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it a few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as general bernie schriever told of his team s work and yes struggle to build this nation s intercontinental ballistic missile what stories can we tell blurry eyed telescopes thousand dollar toilet seats even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time they are and seem destined to remain gen schriever s icbms i find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space lifter idea is to refurbish old minuteman and poseidon ballistic missiles well the pessimists are wrong the legacy is continuing this event is proof to our technological parents we ve listened to your stories we ve caught your enthusiasm and can do spirit and we ve learned from your achievements and your mistakes let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history max hunter you are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration your insight and discipline built the thor icbm later incorporated into today s most successful launch vehicle the delta you told us in the s that a new form of launch vehicle a single stage reusable rocket can and should be built you advocated this idea tirelessly it was elegantly simple as are all great breakthroughs you showed us how to build it you convinced us it could be done you are working by our side to weld its components into place most important you reminded us of a prime engineering principle undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the s and s build a little and test a little and max you passed all of this on to people like pat ladner who started this program for the sdi douglas aircraft didn t start with a dc they didn t even start with a dc our grandfathers built a little tested a little even sold a little and made a little money before they moved on to the next step they didn t take a decade or more before putting the first rubber on the road max hunter you didn t take ten years to build thor and by god we re not going to take ten years to show that low cost single stage reusable aerospace transportation is real we ended the cold war in a few short years it took the same team here today but a few years to show through the strategic defense initiative that the cold war must end we you and us launched a series of satellites the delta experiments in about a year apiece this more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the soviet union those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship but it is the same team which is now putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation we will make space access routine and affordable we built this magnificent flying machine in two years this summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub orbital rocket it will allow us to use space rapidly affordably and efficiently as no other nation can and yes we ll make a little money off it too then and only then we ll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system the dc of space will be a reality we may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries what a wonderful irony if this sdi product and russian efforts to counter sdi merge to power mankind s next step to the stars to be sure we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer robert goddard s first rockets weren t saturn v s if we succumb to the temptation to ask for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system we will fail max hunter and his colleagues showed the way three years and a cloud of dust in our case rocket exhausts there is no short cut if we expect to reshape the world again we must do it one brick at a time minds on tasks at

would sincerely like to thank the u s space foundation my topic today is the single stage rocket technology rocket or ssrt by i intend to speak of more how to lower the cost and make rapid progress ssrt is to my mind and i hope to convince you the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space faster cheaper and better faster cheaper better and ssrt represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another it is a new thing to be sure but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters when we rolled out the ssrt baby two weeks ago so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics it made no sense for example dr eberhart rachtin former president of the aerospace corp said of ssrt in the l a times that it defies the best principles of launching payloads into space well dr rachtin you ve made us mad what are these principles that ssrt defies well i ll tell you it violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware it violates the fact that it takes years to build something new and it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars it took some of the last generation s experts to teach us some new old lessons werhner von braun s first rocket was not a saturn v general schriever s icbm s didn t take ten years to demonstrate and the x airplane didn t cost billion it took one of the great engineers of the s to remind us of these truths max hunter max to remind you was a senior engineer in the thor irbm program and old faster better cheaper success story max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the s because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps build a little test a little next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration we didn t solicit a bunch of requirements they d just change every few years anyway not included in the speech the als nls has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as shape shifter than space lifter we didn t spend a lot money this x rocket only cost million when s the last time we even built a new airplane for that and it didn t take a lot of time to build mcdonnell douglas completed it in months finally the government program office consisted of one very over worked air force major motivated in part by the threat that he d get to ride on it in a strapped on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule as i described what ssrt is and isn t keep in mind its only a first step there are several more steps and steps that can easily fail before the u s can field an ssto but each step should follow the same principles a small management team a few years technology demonstration and a modest budget let me show a few details on ssrt and how it might evolve see charts i m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation the giants of the last great space era the s and s they went to the moon we built a telescope that can t see straight they soft landed on mars the least we could do is soft land on earth but we do have an answer we can follow their build a little test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space i know there are nay sayers among you those who say ssrt is a stunt it needs more thermal protection the engines are wrong it would be better to land horizontally etc etc i say to you we ll see you at white sands in june you bring your view graphs and i ll bring my rocketship if we do what we say we can do then you let us do the next step not

its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up the piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at the end the piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate like a needle in a record before it gets there with a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as earth s shadow upon it and at other

the dark part is the half facing away from the sun even when it appears to be behind us light years between galaxies is a misnomer the distance is closer to zero as time and matter are characteristics

come from wheat is a weed it is programmed to pull from the soil reproduce like hell and then die warning about writing to the past i had a little dream of being in a world in the near parallel future lying along a path of history which we have diverged from there were twelve telepathic glowing beings who looked like an oscar award and who had always been a dark one who looked like us and then myself the dark one was in the process of making the others into gods he had to teach them what that meant by advising them in their past basically he manipulated them into reproducing and raising their children on his seed he said that the little ones who looked different were a sub species meant to provide service he carefully combed through history rewriting it in his favor pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control he enticed recruits by sending them his visions saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls kill or be killed the amount of control he could exert was finite though as at every change he made a void would appear in our reality the universe one day ended meters from us it seemed odd but we couldn t remember how else it should be then some of the twelve were no more finally when he could prune no more and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips he stepped through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all

as you rewrite your own course of history none the wiser as we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time his hierarchy will lose its direction he can still make changes while he s here its just that that is work and with every adjustment this becomes less the world he cultivated which loosens his grip and his organization is suddenly one branch less but he can t see

data transmission videoconferencing business television distance teaching and rural telephony to give but a few examples in opening the door to new telecommunications services which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower frequency bands olympus was the first satellite over europe to offer capacity in the ghz band in establishing two way data relay links olympus received for the first time in europe over several months high volume data from a low earth orbiting spacecraft and then distributed it to various centres in europe when olympus was launched on july it was the world s largest telecommunications satellite and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands olympus users range from individual experimenters to some of the world s largest businesses access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services over the past four years some companies and organisations made use of this opportunity as well as over members of the eurostep distance learning organisation as the new technologies and services tested by these olympus users enter

yamauchi ces cwru edu brian yamauchi writes enzo research canon oz au enzo liguori writes what s new in my opinion friday april washington dc now space marketing is working with university of colorado and livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile long inflatable billboard in low earth orbit this sounds like something lowell wood would think of does anyone know if he s involved no the idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible near term commercial space activities one of the folks involved in those discussions a spacecraft engineer named preston carter passed the suggestion on to some entreprenurial types and mike lawson is apparently going ahead with it preston is now at llnl and is working with space marketing on the sensors that might be carried nasa would provide contractual launch services however since nasa bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates wn mar the taxpayers would bear most of the expense actually that sounds unlikely i don t know what the launch vehicle would be but i would expect it to go on a commercial launcher certainly not on the shuttle and the fraction of the cost paid to nasa for e g launch support would probably cover nasa s incremental costs pretty well this may look like environmental vandalism but mike lawson ceo of space marketing told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment the platform will carry ozone monitors he explained advertising is just to help defray costs this may be the purpose for the university of colorado people my guess is that the purpose for the livermore people is to learn how to build large inflatable space structures no as noted llnl is involved in lightweight sensor design per clementine and related programs i m sure folks around here would like to see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure but after all the u s did the echo satellites long ago and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than echo was or a parade balloon for that matter what do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky it is not even april anymore while i happen to personally dislike the idea mostly because i ve got a background in astronomy it s hardly vandalism it would be a short lived intrusion on the night sky doing no permanent damage and actually hurting only a small subset of astronomers on the other hand it would certainly draw attention to space if this is true i think it s a great idea learning how to build structures in space in an essential step towards space development which unfortunately this is not likely to contribute much to if such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates creative use of partial private sector funding in the process so much the better is nasa really supporting this junk as far as i know it s a purely commercial venture and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn news blip how serious is this project is this just in the wild idea stage or does it have real funding i gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers commercial projects however

university doing research involving rockets c a member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets there are two such organizations the tripoli rocketry association and the national association of rocketry members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own the faa will issue a waiver of its regulations upon request to any organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions to avoid conflicts with aircraft the usual stipulations are only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed depending on the location this ceiling may be from to feet agl the operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited the faa will provide a notam informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time most of the launches that are held and there are dozens of them every year are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light such as over the western deserts the black rock desert north of reno is particularly popular since it is x miles of nothing to hit on the ground the two rocketry associations test and approve

regulations on unmanned rockets anyway see far subpart c for details as for recovery although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to feet most of them only get to to feet the typical rocket is to

this mixing be substantially faster slower at the pressures we re talking about there was an interesting article in scientific american some time ago about breathing liquid it was a few months before the abyss came out as far as i can remember they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid low viscosity if it s too difficult to force the fluid in

the part that isn t expelled is the part that s nearest the walls of the alveoli alveolus so the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done by diffusion of the gas through the fluid apparently oxygen tends to diffuse more readily than co so even if you can get enough oxygen in you might not be able to get enough co out oxygen co capacity you have to be able to dissolve enough gas

phone release hubble telescope servicing mission scheduled for eleven days the december flight of endeavour on space shuttle mission sts to service the hubble space telescope hst has been scheduled as an day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two if needed the decision to schedule five extravehicular activities or evas was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training maneuver times required using the shuttle s robot arm based on software simulations and actual eva tasks on previous missions basically what we ve done by going to five evas rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics or unknowns of spacewalks mission director randy brinkley said it improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real time situations in laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks officials have determined that changing out the gyros solar arrays and the wide field planetary camera wf pc and installing the corrective optics space telescope axial replacement costar are priority objectives during the mission when we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks highest through lowest priority and recognizing that the major tasks gyros solar arrays wf pc and costar would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk five evas were deemed appropriate said milt heflin lead flight director for the mission while the five spacewalks will be unprecedented the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two three or four evas we have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five evas heflin said in planning for all space shuttle missions it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the mission control center called joint integrated simulations lasting between and hours in addition many stand alone underwater training runs will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission also lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the sts crew in its training techniques endeavour s june flight and discovery s july mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the hst mission the evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the johnson space center houston and the

nasa budgets the very survival of a number of missions has been uncertain but thanks to major design refinements implemented in recent months jpl s space infrared telescope facility sirtf a major project considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago is alive and well according to project scientist michael werner a lighter spacecraft revised orbit and shorter mission have added up to a less expensive project with tremendous scientific power and a bright future said werner designed as a follow up to the highly successful infrared astronomical satellite iras and cosmic background explorer cobe missions sirtf a cryogenically cooled observatory for infrared astronomy from space is scheduled for launch in or if plans proceed as scheduled iras pioneering work in space based infrared astronomy years ago allowed astronomers to view the milky way as never before and revealed among other things galaxies and comets it provided a sky survey times more sensitive than any previously available from ground based observations cobe has measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large angular scales and revealed new facts about the early universe but to illuminate sirtf s potential jim evans jpl s manager of astrophysics and fundamental physics pre projects recently said that the project is to million times more capable than iras based on technological advances in infrared detector arrays however despite the enormous strides in infrared exploration sirtf promised and the fact that it was cited as the highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the s by the national academy of sciences it took a diet or die directive from nasa headquarters last year to keep the project going according to werner the project is now known as atlas sirtf based on the key factor in its new design the satellite will orbit the sun instead of the earth permitting the use of an atlas rocket launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier titan the main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your launch capability for boosting the payload you don t have to carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit werner said the other advantage to a solar orbit he said is that it s in a better thermal environment away from the heat of the earth additional major changes in sirtf s redesign include shortening the mission from five to three years and building a spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original plan atlas sirtf will weigh kilograms pounds compared to titan sirtf s kilograms pounds all of that adds up to a less stressful launch environment werner said and a cost savings of more than million for the launch in addition to increased savings in the design of the smaller less massive spacecraft werner said sirtf s redesign came as a result of congress telling nasa you re trying to do too many things if you want us to support sirtf which is a good project develop a plan to see how it fits into nasa s overall strategy shortly thereafter sirtf was named as nasa s highest priority flagship scientific mission by the interdisciplinary space sciences advisory committee in addition to the blessing from the national academy of sciences while the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping to keep the project alive sirtf s major scientific contribution always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector arrays which will allow images to be developed tens of thousands of times faster than before according to evans up until a couple of years ago werner said all infrared astronomy was done with single detectors or very small arrays of individually assembled detectors since then the department of defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or hundreds of thousands of detectors rather than just a few and those are very well suited for use on sirtf werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget pressures congress is currently watching nasa projects with an eye out for any technological spinoff on that question i think we have some things to say he said because the detectors we re using are straight off various military developments also sirtf will be built by the u s aerospace industry and it s a real technological and engineering challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project sirtf will be used by the entire astronomical community werner added but the revised three year mission puts a premium on observing time we have to educate the user community and develop a program that involves early surveys and quick turnaround of the data werner said the downsizing of the project required a reduction in scope and complexity of sirtf s three instruments the infrared spectrograph infrared array camera and multiband imaging photometer however these reductions will only result in losses of efficiency rather than capability he said the project hopes to start a phase b activity in which will provide a detailed concept for development and design building the hardware would begin about two years later projected cost estimates evans said are million million i am very optimistic about sirtf he said it will provide a tremendous return for the investment werner added that an additional benefit from the project will be the enrichment of our intellectual and cultural environment people on the street are very interested in astronomy black holes the possibility of life on other planets the origin of the universe and those are the kind of questions sirtf will help answer ron baalke baalke kelvin jpl

project team recently concluded a week long series of meetings with officials from russia and japan the meetings were part of space vlbi week held at jpl in early march and were intended to maintain cooperation between international space agencies participating in the development of the u s space vlbi project a recently approved jpl flight project set for launch in u s space vlbi will utilize two earth orbiting spacecraft the japanese vsop vlbi space observing program satellite with its meter radio telescope and a russian radioastron meter satellite both spacecraft will team up with ground based radio telescopes located around the world to create a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio telescope observing power by a factor of japan s vsop satellite will use a limited six hour orbit to conduct imaging science while the russian radioastron spacecraft will exploit a larger hour earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy each satellite will point at a source target for roughly hours while approximately ground based radio telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on earth according to dr joel smith jpl s project manager for the u s space vlbi meetings like those held at jpl will permit japan and russia who have little previous experience in radio interferometry to establish working relationships with the radio astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex observations required by the space vlbi project one of our main activities is developing the methodology for international coordination because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while using the ground based radio telescopes to observe the same celestial objects said smith three new tracking antennas are being built at dsn facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in japan russia and green bank w va this global network of ground based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and high speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the information to a correlator located at the national radio astronomy observatory in socorro n m the correlator will combine and process data then make it available to mission investigators in moscow tokyo and jpl via electronic mail smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created by the space vlbi network will provide radio astronomers with better resolution than has ever been achieved before by ground based radio telescopes allowing astronomers to take a closer look at distant objects in space there is a long history of radio astronomy using ground based telescopes said smith what we intend to do is to extend radio astronomy into earth orbit our goal is to look deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei quasars and other active radio sources to understand what drives those things we have seen so far with radio astronomy smith noted that if one examines the active galactic nuclei you ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than light and at energy levels that are millions of times greater than you would expect he said some astronomers believe that black holes may be located in the cores of these galaxies and that they may fuel the jets smith hopes that by using space vlbi to look further into the cores this theory may be supported or disproved russian space flight hardware including transponders and transmitters are now being tested in the united states and japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this year analysis of this hardware will permit u s scientists and engineers to understand how to modify the high speed vlba correlator operating at the nrao in order to accommodate the odd data patterns that will originate from the more than ground based radio telescopes involved in space vlbi smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the japanese and russian space agency officials like those held at jpl in march have proceeded smoothly yet he knows that the political uncertainty in russia could jeopardize that country s participation in the project nothing is ever smooth he said but the russians have been incredibly open with us we always anticipated some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors beyond our control yet there tends to be a way of keeping these things going because scientists on both sides are trying hard and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level smith points out that the japanese space agency has more at stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a science mission the japanese have been extremely cooperative since international cooperation is essential to their science mission he said but smith also noted that japanese space agency officials look at the u s space vlbi mission as an opportunity to showcase the technology involved with vsop spacecraft and their highly regarded mach v launch vehicle yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an ambitious project jpl s smith is satisfied that planning for the space vlbi project is beyond the significant financial and political hurdles

outside but a gem on the inside or the et strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge as you can see from file geodea gif it uses a space shuttle external tank et in place of much of the truss which is currently part of space station freedom the white track on the outside of the et is used by the station remonte manipulator system srms and by the reaction control system rcs pod this allows the rcs pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity cg of the station as the mass properties of the station change during assembly the inline module design allows the shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the station s cg and at a structurally strong part of the station in the current ssf design docking forces are limited to pounds which seriously constrains the design of the docking system the et would have a hatch installed pre flight with little additional launch mass we ve always had the ability to put an et into orbit contrary to some rumors which have circulated here but we ve never had a reason to do it while we have had some good reasons not to performance penalties control debris generation and eventual de orbit and impact footprint once on orbit we would vent the residual h the et insulation sofi either a erodes on orbit from impact with atomic oxygen or b stays where it is and we deploy a kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment option b has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection the et is incredibly strong remember it supports the whole stack during launch and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits the white module at the end of et contains a set of control moment gyros to be used for attitude control while the rcs will be used for gyro desaturation the module also contains a de orbit system which can be used at the end of the station s life to perform a controlled de orbit so we don t kill any more kangaroos like we did with skylab the centrifuge which has the same volume as a hab module could be used for long term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans the centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system the centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules opposite the et and the solar panels

radars the mu middle and upper atmosphere radar features an active phased array system unlike the conventional large vhf radars in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements each of solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element this system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays because phase shift and signal division combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network the antenna beam can be switched within microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of deg since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of

stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be with full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man any lights were supplied solely by nature uncorruptable by men whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars whether by apotheosis or a belief in an

single staget to orbit reusable launch vehicle the dc x vehicle is a scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in ssto it is currently undergoing tests the dc y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit it has not yet been funded on april th rocky nelson of macdonnell douglas gave a talk entitled optimizing techniques for advanced space missions here at the university of illinois mr nelson s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements although he is not directly involved with the delta clipper project he has spent time with them recently using his software for their applications he thus used the dc y project for most of his examples while i don t think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers i hope they aren t i fell asleep during that part i think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples the first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit the main restriction is that acceleration must remain below gs i assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints but i did not verify that the delta clipper y version has engines boosters and sustainers the boosters which have a lower isp are shut down in mid flight thus one critical question is when to shut them down mr nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time g as ascii graphs go this is actually fairly good the big difference is that the lines g made by the should be curves which are concave up the data is only approximate as the graph wasn t up for very long g g sec sec as mentioned before a critical constraint is that g levels must be kept below initially all eight engines are started as the vehicle burns fuel the accelleration increases as it gets close to g the booster engines are throtled back however they quickly become inefficient at low power so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether this causes the dip in accelleration at about seconds eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the g level back up to about and then hold it there until they cut out entirely the engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit the trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly thus lowering the final altitude to that desired questions from the audience paraphrased q would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs rather than all at once a very perceptive worth considering they have not yet done the simulation shutting down all four was part of the problem as given q so what was the final payload for this trajectory a can t tell us read aviation leak he also apparently had a good propulsion example but was told not to use it my question does anyone know if this security is due to sdio protecting national security or md protecting their own interests the second example was reentry simulation from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver the biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange he showed graphs of heating using two different models to show that both were very similar and i think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate the end result was that for a polar orbit landing at ksc the dc y would have about degrees of crossrange and would start it s reentry profile about degrees

taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine permission is granted to copy this without restriction michael sternberg cheif of operations of rimsat was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control disarmament and international security rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launchers and satellites i think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the international relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson went to tonga to visit a friend while he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king who happened to be a big tv fan matt bought the king a satellite dish which the king thought was really nifty since tonga has a gnp of about million his majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this matt thought there probably was so at his suggestion tonga applied for geosynchronous satellite slots while this isn t entirely off the wall it was very unusual seeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and is a lot of slots the whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions supporting tonga s case eventually tonga ended up with slots ranging from e to e slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside according to sternberg four of these from e to e are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat was formed to use these slots it was officially formed in nevis as a tax haven they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to fill slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately billion it s not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh terms that i don t think i ll visit there for a long time besides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way that people operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for satellites at a cost of million however glavkosmos lost favor after the coup sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures since glavkosmos was out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms eventually he worked out a deal and on dec he met with koptev who heads the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat the next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware npo applied mechanics npo pm to use their acronym this organization is located in siberia can t figure out how to spell the town i need an atlas and has built about vehicles since the dawn of the space age sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites they are hard workers honest people who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners at this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners sternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm his company is apparently lookng for million to invest in the firm to become partners it apparently costs the russians about million to build a satellite that would sell for million in the west if you want to give them specifications they ll build you a satellite for the particular satellites that rimsat will be using costs run about per transponder year this compares to t y in the u s they can sell their time for about million compared to million in the u s rimsat will launch their satellites on protons to get the best prices they bought in bulk they have the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians which is being moved into place now tidbits sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big business because big business is just like what they have over there except that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier russian launches are self insured the promise to replace a failed launch within months major investors in rimsat include russell which is a huge retirement fund organization cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast asia and a fund operated by some of the big names in u s aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off he downplayed the instabilites in the ex ussr saying that we are worried partly because we aren t used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying monolith italy gets a new government every two weeks but we don t worry because we re used to it he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in russia we won t worry about their stability as much part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in rubles to get around this rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites which was rather reassuring the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the older gorizont horizon satellites have a lifetime of about years while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about years while this is much shorter than years for western satellites sternberg downplayed the difference at these prices they can afford to launch new ones in addition shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date hardware josh hopkins jbh uxa cso uiuc edu find a way or make one attributed to hannibal\n", "label": "space"}, {"text": "re space station redesign jsc

population of grbs the data indicates that we are less than of the radius of the center of the distribution the only things the earth is at the exact center of are the solar system at the scale of the oort cloud of comets way beyond pluto and the universe cosmological theories placing grbs throughout the universe require supernova type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds oort cloud models tend to be silly even by the standards of astrophysics if grbs were galactic i e distributed through the milky way galaxy you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the galaxy for a disk population or towards the galactic center for a spherical halo population we don t see this so if they are galactic they must be in a halo at least light years in radius and we

place them closer in pat well lets see i took a class on this last fall and i have no notes so i ll try to wing it here s how i understand it remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars pulsars are formed from high mass stars m star m sun high mass stars live fast and burn hard taking appoximately years before going nova or supernova in this time they don t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane so any of these if assumed to be the sources of grb s will be in the plane of the galaxy then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system pioneer venus has one either pion or ginga and of course batse and we do distribution tests on our catalog these tests all show that the bursts have an isotropic distribution evenly spread out in a radial direction and they show signs of homogeneity i e they do not clump in any one direction so unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy we are sampling the universe not cool if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things now i suppose you are saying well we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk well not necessarily remember we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond pluto pioneer so we should be able with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite here s an analogy you see a plane overhead you measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system one of your friends a mile away sees the same plane and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system which is the same as yours the two angles are different and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst and maybe find a source to my knowledge no one has been able to do this i should throw in why halo and corona models don t work also as i said before looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts short timescales high energy black holes and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior if this is the case as i said before these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy especially the most energetic of the these sources when you look at a simulated model where the bursts are confined to the disk but you sample out to large distances say mpc you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction but a clumping of sources in the direction of the galactic center as i said before there is none of these characteristics i think that s all of it if someone needs clarification or knows something that i don t know by all means correct me i had the honor of taking the bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these different distributions so we pretty much kicked around every possible distribution there was and some very outrageous sources colliding pulsars black holes pulsars

from broadcast and cable tv networks similarly remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to m in up us commercial space revenues r e commercial satellites satellite services fixed mobile satellite ground equip mobile equipment commercial launches remote sensing data and services private microgravity research lab total annual revenues r revised data for e estimated data for commentary this is the first look at how the us commercial space industry is expected to do in in general not a bad report with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area there changes of only a few satellites worth m or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection if we look forward over several years this market sector should retain strong sales as us firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business furthermore sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data expected to be released about mid year data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales including such items as gps receivers and portable satellite terminals appears to be missing from the january data set doc usually publishes a listing of space business indicators in mid year and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then i expect the revised revenues should easily top m if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers and the year should show about a overall market growth looking beyond this year s data future markets look quite promising the doc projects satellite service revenues could top m by if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at per year through the mid s my numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near term market growth but i agree the trend should be for substantial growth in us commercial space sales over at least the next years my pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in leo communications and satellite direct broadcasting services i don t believe all of the current players in the yet to be born leo communications satellite market and in the yet to be proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected it should also be noted this year s doc data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities the m shown in the janurary data is primarily for the spacehab module planned for launch in april on the space shuttle but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module delta wins two key launch contracts mcdonnell douglas corporation which builds and markets the delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts motorola inc announced in mid february that it had selected the delta to launch most of the satellites in the satellite iridium leo communications constellation and in mid april mcdonnell douglas was awarded the usaf medium launch vehicle iii contract the launch services contract with motorola for the iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least iridium satellites another satellites have been contracted to be launched by khrunichev enterprise in russian on proton vehicle launches these satellites planned for the delta will be launched at a time providing for at least launches additional satellites in the iridium constellation such as a planned on orbit spares may also be launched on delta although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation and not yet final the usaf mlv contract also went to mdc bidding a variant of their delta ii launcher this contract is only initially worth million but establishes a set of launch options for up to launches encompassing launches from through these launches will deploy the next generation of the usaf s global positioning system block iir navigation satellites plus other programs first option for to meet the usaf launch options is expected to be exercised this year after which the usaf is expected to request launches of up to deltas per year for at least years under this contract the usaf can also request launch on demand services from mdc for the time period with a launch to occur within days of the request commentary if these two contracts are fulfilled they should provide an excellent business base for mdc s delta launch program through the turn of the century combined these two contracts have a potential for about launches worth about m to mdc and sustaining a core business base of m year other contracts for international and commercial payloads as well as for nasa medium elv class payloads will add to this business base keeping mdc as a viable commerical launch company however it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts motorola s iridium leo communications constellation has not yet received a us federal communications commission license for operation in the u s nor has motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the iridium venture without these approvals or financial backing there will be no iridium launches but hopefully these uncertainties will be settled this year similarly the usaf mlv iii program has been the target of several congressional actions which have slowed the production of the gps block iir satellites and deleted the funding for the mlv iii program in favor of the usaf nls spacelifter program at this time while it appears the mlv iii contract will be executed future funding for the mlv iii and other usaf commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews some opinions expressed from within the administration and congress propose cancellation of all elv upgrade programs including the mlv programs in favor of the proposed spacelifter program such opinions may have some weight in this year s budget deliberations particularly as dod funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking us defense budget commercial remote sensing venture gets doc go ahead the first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early february by the us department of commerce s office of space commerce a license was granted to worldview imaging corporation of oakland california to build and operate a pair of leo imaging satellites to provide multi spectral images of the earth commentary there has been little data released on this venture by worldview and the doc other than the announcement of the operating and construction license this was reported to be at the request of worldview most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a star wars spinoff using sdi type technology to provide digital earth sensing data and heavily integrated into digital gis databases for remote sensing gis users most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists agricultural planners and urban planners it is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the land remote sensing policy act the act as passed last november provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices prior to this act remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government set landsat data prices there are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development i think the large landsat and spot satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so in contrast to these large government sponsored remote sensing systems smaller market ventures such as worldview and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology and i believe can find profitability on the margin i predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so investment firm calls gd s space biz still a good investment wall street investment house morgan stanley thinks general dynamic s space systems division could still be a moneymaker despite having failed in the last atlas launches in a recent analyst s report morgan stanley said we are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the atlas to its historical plus success rate this will become a highly profitable cash generating unit based upon discussions with gd s corporate management morgan stanley projects that if the atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see m in earnings per year by and m per year by this is based upon gd s projection of capturing about atlas launches per year on the world market commentary three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt general dynamic s space systems division since gd has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses many market pundits have been speculating gd s space business might be next to be sold the morgan stanley report indicates gd s space systems division has some potential as a moneymaker despite current problems if they can get their act together sales are projected to be about m in which will probably generate a loss of about m if gd can capture their projected share of the space launch market and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their atlas launchers then they could generate healthy profits from those sales but until they demonstrate the atlas centaur program is back on track this division will continue to show substantial losses in response to the sell off rumors in my opinion this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability to do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm in gd ssd s case to get the division back on track the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the atlas centaur as well as in selling atlas services this would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in house and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services optimally the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well candidates for this might be trw rockwell lockheed and martin and possibly mcdonnell douglas and boeing but most of those firms have cash flow problems mdc have had a substantial business contraction boeing and mdc are involved with other launch firms lockheed or have taken on substantial debt martin and coming up with the m purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company ariane predicts dip in launch demand arianespace the operator of the ariane launch system is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late s in early february arianespace released their annual market survey which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade over short run arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market of international and commercial launches planned through ariane holds contracts for general dynamics atlas vehicle holds contracts mcdonnell douglas delta holds and great wall s long march vehicle holds launch contracts three quarters of future launch contracts for which ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining split between weather earth observation and scientific satellites most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the asia pacific region arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by over today s average level to about kg in geo demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years but in the second half of the decade arianespace predicts demand will decrease arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near term transponders one of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles including russian launch systems but arianespace predicts that in the long term investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price and that russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal commentary ariane releases their market surveys annually and i reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of csn sti comparing the two surveys there aren t outstanding differences in the numbers the most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit i note that in contrast to some predictions demand for space based communications transponders appears to be remain strong while fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point to point telecommunications markets growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point to multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service but only from established point a to established point b to establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points and while there are improved network solutions installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars for broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure satellites still offer the most cost effective solution and if new services are required into a new region it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network this allows rapid growth of new satellite services and has kept demand high the replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well since as demand grows between the points serviced it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly satellite market projections remain rosy but satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at years of on orbit service or more in contrast to years of service from last generation s satellites this has cut back some of the launch demand as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals and as last note arianespace didn t flag it this year but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over supplied by existing launch systems in the near term the annual commercial launch demand is for about medium sized satellites per year from the supply side ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year delta is capable of about per year atlas is capable of long march japan s h vehicle russia s proton capable of and other systems such as zenit and soyuz another medium launches per year that s a lot of capability for a small market we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort the feb pegasus launch by orbital sciences corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules a valid abort order from a nasa range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules in the last few minutes of the pegasus launch countdown one of two abort command receivers aboard the pegasus failed such a failure typically scrubs a launch and a nasa range safety officer at wallops island va issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled pegasus launch somehow this command was overridden by the osc launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels and the pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call fortunately the pegasus functioned as expected and the abort command receiver was not needed but this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed to launch constraint rules and was not obeyed leading the investigation is the national transportation safety board ntsb with support from nasa osc and the air force this investigation marks the first time ntsb has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch according to the ntsb their investigation will take about months and is primarily looking at lines of authority communications links and safety procedures used in the launch commentary this is the first time that the ntsb has led an investigation into a space launch their leadership was requested by the department of commerce s office of commercial space transportation who had licensed the commercial launch at the time of writing this column some of the initial investigations have been concluded and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press apparently or four different communications channels were in use during the test after the abort destruct receiver stopped responding the nasa test director and range controller in the mission control room at wallops island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch according to the mission rules this should have stopped the launch somehow the osc test conductor ordered the abort reversed and the nasa communicator on the net relayed that order to the b carrying the pegasus at about seconds before launch differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch as we see more and more commercial launches more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved this case is interesting because it is the first time the ntsb has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem as they do with commercial aircraft problems i think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated another pegasus competitor is announced tsniimach enterprise in russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system based upon converted icbm components two versions of the launcher are being marketed the aerokosmos winged vehicle launched like the osc pegasus and the severkosmos launched from a mobile ground transporter the aerokosmos is projected to deliver kg to a km circular orbit or kg to an km circular orbit and the severkosmos to be capable of kg to km orbits and kg to km also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a leo data relay system called sineva tsniimach enterprise is described as a ex military establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the buran shuttle system they are located near the npo energia facility in kaliningrad outside of moscow commentary there s very little released information on this new venture my suspicion is it is another russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in house knowledge of ex soviet launch systems it adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex soviet union this one s a little different in that they are offering variants of ex soviet icbms but i can t identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing georgia launch site dropped from planning in late january georgia tech research institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in camden county georgia at the old kingsland missile test launching site on the atlantic coast the preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns plus environmental and other geographic considerations however the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses and recommended other potential uses commentary this should put the nails in the coffin of the kingsland commercial launch site while other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development this might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site these include is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs is there a market advantage of using the site can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment other commercial launch site ventures including those at woomera poker flat cape york white sands alabama off shore platform hawaii and vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria in my opinion some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grounds spain s capricornia launcher still proceeding in one of his last official acts former president bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between us and other firms one of these was a proposed use of us technology by spain to build a small booster with that regulatory impediment removed the stage capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year planning for a first launch in the time period the capricornia is described as a small stage all solid booster designed to put kg into leo several launch sites are being examined for the system including on the iberian peninsula and on the canary islands originated by inta in spain the project reports it has m in development funding and will use technology from argentina s condor launch vehicle as well as from the us commentary several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the european market small payloads from european firms or organizations currently use either ariane piggyback launches or the us italian scout launcher however ariane piggyback opportunities are limited and the scout program is being phased out accompanied by some disarray in the italian government and space industry regarding any follow on system this has left an apparent niche for a new european small launch system surprisingly enough esa has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure studies have been performed by british aerospace aerospatiale deutsche aerospace and italian organizations but with the exception of the swedish pacastro system reported below i have not been able to find any other european development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware also of interest is the linking of the capricornia to the argentinian condor launcher there have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of argentina over the past year about a space launcher irbm program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the s and early s what is known is in feb the argentinian air force formally transferred control of the condor missile program to the new civilian argentinian national space agency comison nacional de atividades espaciales cnae the condor program was described as originating in expanding upon the smaller condor rocket program in collaboration with egypt and with support of german firms the condor was also reportedly funded indirectly by iraq in the mid s fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested but argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system it should be noted cnae is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late the us m kg sac b satellite will study the earth s upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from italy and the us no launch vehicle has yet been selected but osc s pegasus and the russian burlak air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp pacastro a small launch firm in herndon virginia announced in late february it had received a m launch reservation contract from the swedish space corp to launch a satellite on pacastro s pa launch vehicle this will be performed as part of the polar satellite service pss a joint norwegian space center swedish space corp program to upgrade the andoya rocket range in norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions according to pacastro pss is also performing an m upgrade of the andoya launch facilities including a new integration facility and a fully enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the pacastro pa pacastro has been chosen as the main alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service to be offered by pss from andoya the date of the launch of the swedish satellite was not specified commentary pacastro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now the pa is a small two stage rocket fueled by rp and liquid oxygen from pacastro s literature the engines designed for the pa series rockets are built of off the shelf components based upon the lunar module descent engines built by trw and are capable of putting a kg satellite into a km circular polar orbit pacastro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three pa vehicles with a first launch planned for and orbital launches planned for my records show pacastro hired trw to provide marketing support and systems design with primary engineering to be done by aeroastro a small satellite builder closely associated with pacastro headquartered in the same building the swedish space corporation would supply engineering launch operations vehicle subsystems and marketing support sumitomo corp of tokyo is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors pacastro has gotten a first round financial package of at least k some sources place this of high as m but has been searching for about a year for the additional m needed to design build and launch their first set of vehicles the launch reservation from ssc can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board but by my estimate they will need much more than the single m sale to put their venture into real hardware china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported in early march it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a taiwanese and mainland chinese was in the works as reported in the taipei press china development corp cdc headquartered in taiwam and with links to the ruling nationalist party is planning to set up a joint venture in hong kong with china great wall industry corp with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite cdc would cover about of the satellite system cost us m in exchange for rights to of the satellite s communications channels commentary this announcement came close on the heels of the release of taiwanese plans for space development released in mid january in those plans the national space program office of taiwan will launch satellites starting with rocsat a kg scientific spacecraft planned for launch in two additional satellites are planned both communications satellites trw has been helping taiwan plan this program budgeted at t b us m through i haven t been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the nspot but there might be a connection while taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures the current taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures the reported name for the tiawanese chinese system is asiasat but i don t thinks this has any relationship with the existing hong kong based asiasat program involving chinese hong kong and other asian investors other than using it as an organizational model there are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture it could provide excellent first hand experience to taiwan for a very low cost which then can be used in later satellite ventures but there are internal political issues between taiwanese and chinese ventures but putting any joint venture through a hong kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed in any case the east asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues this is just another indicator to add to the list south korea announces national move into space technologies south korea s trade industry and resources ministry recently announced plans to invest us b in research and development and another us b into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi purpose satellite by the objective of this investment is to raise south korea s aerospace technology to the level of the world s top countries by commentary south korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry specifically including space activities i m noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market as part of their national effort national telecommunications satellites for korea telecom will be launched in april and oct on delta designated koreasat and the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the korean peninsula southwestern japan and portions of china bordering north korea south korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on ariane in aug called uribyol our star and costing about us m uribyol is planned for piggyback launch in october of this year again on ariane and will be entirely made in korea uribyol projected for a launch will be an environment monitoring micro satellite this satellite may be the precursor to a series of small earth observation satellites the keos korean earth observation system project which has been submitted for approval to the south korean government would use two or three kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors south korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort funded at us m between and in anticipation of an expected pullout of u s intelligence gathering systems from the korean peninsula in conjunction with all of these reported efforts south korean is also pursuing production work either as off sets to existing aerospace technology contracts for example mcdonnell douglas is offsetting production of some delta parts to south korean firms as part of the koreasat launch contracts or for production of consumer space items among other products south korea exports satellite receiver television setups to japan and samsung has announced teaming for production of osc s orbcomm user terminals this looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies considering that east asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services primarily for telecommunications a south korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade space technology indexes through march as announced in the last csn sti each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments the table below summarizes results to the end of march the space technology index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole as represented by the s p index since of the values included in the index are us firms this represents a general increase in the market value of space related firms the increase in the first quarter is more than in all of which is a very promising sign although future months may reverse this trend the commercial space technology index has also done quite well but the pure play portfolio consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies has also surpassed its results in all of we ll keep an eye on these index results through march beginning beginning jan to mar s p space tech index comm l space tech index space tech pure plays final notes what this column s already full and i still have bunches of commercial space developments to report

reflector from a progress vehicle after it had departed from the mir space station while this banner reflector was blank npo energia was very active in reporting that future banner reflectors will be available to advertisers who could use a space based video of their logo or ad printed on the banner in a tv commercial as filmed from the mir the second development has been that space marketing inc the same company responsible for merchandising space on the conestoga booster and comet spacecraft is now pushing the environmental billboard as laid out by smi chief engineer dr ron humble of the university of colorado space laboratory and preston carter of the lawrence livermore national laboratory the environmental billboard is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to x meters advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area deployed by the inflatable frame to help sell the concept the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ozone reading sensors to continuously monitor the condition of the earth s delicate protective ozone layer according to mike lawson head of smi furthermore the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of days it will be released to re enter the earth s atmosphere according to imi as the biodegradable material burns it will release ozone building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer the remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it too re enters and burns up and adds to the ozone supply this would not be a cheap advertisement costing at least several millions of dollars exact costs were not available but smi estimates that market exposure would be x that of the people who watched the superbowl where a second advertising unit cost since smi is located in atlanta georgia it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the summer olympics in atlanta but back to brian s questions and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn news blip how serious is this project is this just in the wild idea stage or does it have real funding see above as for serious if they can get m or so my estimate of for development costs and a flight unit plus m for a launch then it s probably real they are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can t piggy back upon someone else s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch that s a m cost they need to raise right there and there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well note there is one potential legal challenge to smi on the use of launch vehicle advertising already while i don t think the legal challenges would win out and yes i am an amateur astronomer and no i don t really like the idea of this additional light pollution but i know of no prohibition of it the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising i can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure and negate the space advertising advantage would you spend m to look like an idiot and light pollution might not be too bad if it s in a low enough orbit and it relies upon reflected light only it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn for maximum market exposure you want to have it visible just after dusk minimizing impact on astronomy since that s the time of worse seeing due to day night thermal turbulence it might still be a problem but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this as for having real funding none that i can identify there were about expressions of interest made on the conestoga advertising opportunity but that included curious folks and was for only a commitment i haven t heard of any serious funding for this but i m sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more but i am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time and if anybody wants to cross post this to sci astro please be my guest i don t have posting privileges to that area or at least i don t think i do wales larrison space technology investor maximus wb\n", "label": "space"}, {"text": "space advertising of brian yamauchi asks regarding orbital billboards and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn news blip how serious is this project is this just in the wild idea stage or does it have real funding well i had been collecting data for next edition of the commercial space news space technology investor to summarize space advertising first advertising on space vehicles is not new it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization s logos on the space launch vehicle for example the latest gps launcher had the very prominent logos on its side of mcdonnell douglas the delta launcher rockwell international who built the gps satellite usaf who paid for the satellite and launch and the gps navstar program office this has not been considered paid advertising but rather public relations since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side and there was no money exchanged for this however putting a high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is advertising as much as it is public relations in my opinion and by the way i note that the dc x test vehicle has rather prominent mcdonnell douglas and sdio logos on the side there have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising or placing large advertising signs in orbit on the shuttle for example i know of several serious studies in the early and mid s which looked at putting logos on the external tank or on the sides of the payload bay these ventures would be different than public relations in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization for example painting the et to look like a pepsi can or putting a disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it adverts on launch vehicles the first paid advertising was done on a soviet launcher in about when several non involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a proton launch an italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers i remember similarly soviet cosmonauts on mir made a paid advertisement for the last olympic games and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations mars candy bars for example got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the british visiting cosmonaut to mir now us firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles the upcoming conestoga launch in june putting the comet recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side for arnold schwarzenegger s upcoming movie the last action hero besides the usual logos of the participating organizations columbia pictures has paid to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission s conestoga rocket its booster rockets and on the comet payload which will orbit the earth for one month a concept for this advertising display was published in space news magazine a couple of months ago as a side note robert lorsch an advertising executive is talking about suing nasa he charges nasa with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in to form corporate advertising sponsorships on nasa spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming comet nasa violated an agreement that it would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for nasa and receiving compensation this is being disputed since the launch is a commercial launch and nasa is receiving none of the advertising revenues but the funding for the comet program is coming from nasa orbital billboards orbital billboards have been the staple of science fiction for some time arthur c clarke wrote about one example and robert heinlein described

access digex com pat writes what evidence indicates that gamma ray bursters are very far away their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution crudely speaking indicates we re seeing an edge to the distribution given the enormous power i was just wondering what if they are quantum black holes or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic ranges now in the good old days before gro data it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy it was expected that gro would confirm this by either showing they were a local population within a few hundred light years or that they were in the galactic halo mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed also to be fair it was noted that the brightest burster was probably in the lmc suggesting theorists might be wrong back then as the sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out the energy then gets large the mechanism of getting ns out that far becomes questionable and we should start to see for example the andromeda s bursters the data is consistent with either a oort cloud distribution but only just but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum or it can be a cosmological distances hence isotropy and the edge is the edge of the universe if at cosmological distances you need very high energy to detect and a very compact source for spectrum ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole even then getting the spectrum is very hard but conceivable if we know anything about physics at that level the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings wrong spectrum for one thing the situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources in the colliding ns they d actually probably fit relatively easily into the ns ns and ns bh collision scenarios respectively my own pet theory is that it s flying saucers entering hyperspace but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes that they are colliding nuetron stars or spinning black holes i just wondered if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in if you can think of one remember to invite me to stockholm steinn

orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists claim to be looking for a unified field theory in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations but they have been systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for years the late physicist dewey b larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he calls the reciprocal system is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and in two reciprocal forms space and time the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean from these two postulates larson developed a complete theoretical universe using various combinations of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational rotational motions the concepts of in ward and out ward scalar motions and speeds in relation to the speed of light which larson called unit velocity and the natural datum at each step in the development larson was able to match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the real physical universe photons sub atomic particles incomplete atoms charges atoms molecules globular star clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white dwarf stars pulsars quasars etc even objects not yet discovered then such as exploding galaxies and gamma ray bursts and applying his theory to his new model of the atom larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter atomic distances in crystals and molecules compressibility and thermal expansion of solids and other properties of matter all of this is described in good detail with out fancy complex mathematics in his books books of dewey b larson the following is a complete list of the late physicist dewey b larson s books about his

available from the international society of unified science isus e atkin ave salt lake city utah this is the organization that was started to promote larson s theory they have other related publications including the quarterly journal reciprocity physicist dewey b larson s background physicist dewey b larson was a retired engineer chemical or electrical he was about years old when he died in may he had a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute chemical properties based only on the elements used larson s lack of a fancy ph d degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is not a valid reason sometimes it takes a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the trees at the same time it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradictions ad hoc assumptions principles of impotence in consistencies etc larson did not have the funds etc to experimentally test his theory and it was not necessary for him to do so he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational data and in many cases his explanation fit better a self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox physicists and astronomers have they claim to be looking for a unified field theory that works but have been ignoring one for over years now modern physics does not explain the physical universe so well some parts of some of larson s books are full of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree and remember that epicycles crystal spheres geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed to explain it well but were later proved conceptually wrong prof frank h meyer professor emeritus of uw superior was is a

particles mesons hyperons alleged quarks etc which they are finding in existing colliders fermi lab cern etc are really just atoms of anti matter which are created by the high energy colliding beams and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment a larger and more expensive collider will only create a few more elements of anti matter that the physicists have not seen there before and the physicists will be even more confused than they are now are a few more types of anti matter atoms worth the billion cost don t we have much more important uses for this wasted money another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground cables how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the supercollider naming the super collider after ronald reagon as proposed is totally absurd if it is built it should be named after a leading particle physicist larsonian anti matter in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti matter is not a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles it has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum in larson s theory a positron is actually a particle of matter not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their respective photons of which they are made neutralize each other in larson s theory the anti matter half of the physical universe has three dimensions of time and only one dimension of space and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the rate of seconds of arc per century seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets venus earth jupiter etc the remaining seconds of arc are being used to help prove einstein s general theory of relativity but the late physicist dewey b larson achieved results closer to the seconds than general relativity can by instead using special relativity in one or more of his books he applied the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally rejected general relativity as another mathematical fantasy he also rejected most of special relativity including the parts about mass increases near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts those quasars with red shifts greater than really are moving faster than the speed of light although most of that motion is away from us in time in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there are three dimensions of time instead of only one but two of those dimensions can not be measured from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure is the clock time at low relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are negligible but at high speeds they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor larson often used the term coordinate time when writing about this in regard to mass increases it has been proven in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration is acceleration force mass a f m orthodox physicists are ignoring the third factor force in larson s theory mass stays constant and force drops toward zero force is actually a motion or combinations of motions or relations between motions including inward and outward scalar motions the expansion of the universe for example is an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so called big bang which is yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion by dewey b larson north pacific publishers p o box portland oregon pages indexed hardcover it contains the astrophysical portions of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author an unrecognized genius more than thirty years ago it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries including the formation of galaxies binary and multiple star systems and solar systems the true origin of the degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts and the true nature of quasars pulsars white dwarfs exploding galaxies etc it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with open minds the following is an example of his theory s success in his first book in the structure of the physical universe larson predicted the existence of exploding galaxies several years before astronomers started finding them they are a necessary consequence of larson s comprehensive theory and when quasars were discovered he had an immediate related explanation for them also gamma ray bursts astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts they were originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the disc of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly and their source locations in space do not correspond to any known objects except for a few cases of directional coincidence gamma ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson according to page of his book the universe of motion published in the gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material halves of the physical universe and the way they are connected together the gamma ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this is why the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects and come from all directions uniformly i wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were actually caused by nearby gamma ray bursts larsonian binary star formation about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double but orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them but binary star systems are actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson i will try to summarize larsons explanation which is detailed in chapter of his book the universe of motion and in some of his other books first of all according to larson stars do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse the rest results from the complete annihilation of heavy elements heavier than iron each element has a destructive temperature limit the heavier the element is the lower is this limit a star s internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements when the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of iron there is a type i supernova explosion this is because there is so much iron present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process which larson explains in some of his books better than i can when the star explodes the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion pushes that material over the speed of light and it expands outward in time which is equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappears for a while over long periods of time both masses start to fall back gravitationally the material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a red giant star the material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a white dwarf star both stars then start moving back toward the main sequence from opposite directions on the h r diagram the chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space making a single lone star again are near zero they will instead form a binary system orbiting each other according to larson a white dwarf star has an inverse density gradient is densest at its surface because the material at its center is most widely dispersed blown outward in time this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter neutron stars black holes etc larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf stars revolving around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected by its heat etc these will become planets in chapter of the universe of motion larson used all this information and other principles of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode s law black hole fantasy i heard that physicist stephen w hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black holes merging together into a single black hole and concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than the sum of the two original black holes such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red flag causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black holes etc after reading physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially his book the universe of motion it is clear to me that black holes are nothing more than mathematical fantasies the strange object at cygnus x is just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to prove their theory by the way i do not understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist stephen hawking the physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking s severe physical problem somehow makes him wiser it does not i wish the same attention had been given to physicist dewey b larson while he was still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be given to larson s theory books and organization the international society of unified science electro magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many years ago in connection with ufo s and unorthodox inventors but i never was able to find out how or why they work or how they are constructed i found a possible clue about why they might work on pages of the book basic properties of matter by the late physicist dewey b larson which describes part of larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe i quote one paragraph as indicated in the preceding chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electrons we find are derived from the environment it was brought out in volume i larson s book nothing but motion that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities and that although the motions that constitute these electrons are in many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited it follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector material half of the universe most of which are uncharged in this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space because they are inherently rotating units of space and the relation of space to space is not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later whereby electrons are returned to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level note that in larson s theory uncharged electrons are also massless and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity is the speed of light and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light according to larson s theory i might have the above and below labels mixed up larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass less un charged electrons flying around at the speed of light if this is true then the electro magnetic propulsion fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons or other particles in space perhaps giving them a charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion in larson s theory an electrical charge is a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds suppression of larsonian physics the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson has been available for more than years published in in his first book the structure of the physical universe it is totally un scientific for hawking wheeler sagan and the other sacred priests of the religion they call science or physics or astronomy etc as well as the scientific literature and the education systems to totally ignore larson s theory has they have larson s theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such as gamma ray bursts and the nature of quasars larson s theory deserves to be honestly and openly discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals in the u s and elsewhere and at least the basic principles of larson s theory should be included in all related courses at uw ec uw madison cambridge cornell university and elsewhere so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the dogma they are being fed for more information answers to your questions etc please consult my cited sources especially larson s books un altered reproduction and dissemination of this important
